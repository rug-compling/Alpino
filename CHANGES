experimental new feature. A word ~w1~w2~w3 is interpreted as
either word w1, or word w2 or word w3. This is useful, probably,
only in combination with @alt.  This can be used if a pre-processor
suspects that a word is mistyped, but also wants to keep the
original possibility. E.g:

ik ben [ @alt ~u~uw u ] dienaar
ik was [ @alt ~dien~die dien ] dag al vroeg op
de [ @alt ~luiden~lieden~luide luiden ] stormden naar het plein

potential not downward compatible: a word that starts with ~ and has a
further ~ somewere is now only treated as if it is meta.

---

The meta-notation @add_lex is still supported, but only for a single word
at the time. We now use the tag @alt for such cases (possibly in combination
with @skip). Refer to the user manual for a few examples. The implemenation
has been simplified and improved.

---

if you want to see which words are unknown for Alpino, you can use
this:

Alpino -notk pos_tagger=off display_lexical_analysis=unknowns unknowns=off batch_command=lex_all

for each input line (possibly single word per line), the word(s) without any
lexical analysis are reported

---

important difference for evaluation and computation of CA:
no longer the first non-lexical element of the top is used
as daughter, but a special "none" type is used. As a result,
punctuation etc is not counted as incorrect if you happen
to have skips in the parse.

---

* bug fixed: interaction of with_dt with skips

* the binary version no longer requires boost (note that
some of the other binaries in bin still need boost)

* the binary version now is compiled with tcltk 8.6

* we now also have <parser skips= cats=> for automatically produced parses

* automatic correction of some spell mistakes is now recorded in the history value, so these
are now recognizable

* dtview dttred now also maintain metadata and sentid; similarly for
the dtcanonicalize.py script

* options changed 

-xml_canonical File

writes canonical version of xml from File to standard output

-xml_canonical_overwrite File1 File2 .. Filen

overwrites canonical version of xml in each file

* metadata is now maintained in xml_canonical and xml_canonical_overwrite; likewise for sentid attribute

* meta notation  [ @wordid Id ] removed again; not thought to be useful

* Derivbank is removed from Alpino, at least for now, due to
  segmentation violations

* bug where ] is directly followed by [ in meta

* @sentid output in <sentence>, value of flag current_ref; only used in output, not read in;
only used if xml_format_frame=on. 

* new meta notation [ @add_lex Word W ] can be used to treat word W as if it was written as Word

* [ @phantom ] in interaction with converse_unary, should now no longer produce unary branching

* [ @folia Lemma Postag W ] meta-notation: assign given Lemma and Postag to W. Note that this
mechanism only ensures that the given postag and lemma notation ends up in the resulting XML,
but no effort is made to ensure that the Alpino analysis is actually consistent with those
assignments.

* bug report of Andreas van Cranenburgh "geen omkijken hebben naar" is now corrected

* for Vincent: no longer open(bracket) etc in xml output

* for Ineke/Liesbeth: no longer _DIM in lemma; lemma van meisje=meisje

* for QtLeap:
  -generate
  will read ADT in XML from stdin (one XML per line!)

* for QtLeap:
  end_hook=print_generated_sentence 
  will print the generated sentence to stdout

* for QtLeap development:
  end_hook=adt_xml_dump
  will print ADT XML to stdout (one XML per line)

* generator: no longer produces permutations of various list-valued dependency labels
such as mod, cnj, crd, app

* as a result, you should not use the canonical representation for building adt: order_canonical_dt=off

* for Kilian: end_hook=postags  and end_hook=pts will produce long (short) form of CGN-style part-of-speech labels

* generator: repaired several bugs that were introduced lately.
Also: generate punctuation (end of sentence), as well as a
capital at the beginning of a sentence.

* if you want to compile Alpino from sources, you no longer need
Jan Daciuk's s_fsa package: the .fsa and .tpl packages are part
of the source distribution, for ease of installation.

* xml output now also contains lemma attribute

* pos-tagger now returns/reports -log probabilities, normalized per position
in the string

* much improved CGN/D-COI/LASSY-like part-of-speech tags. Postags should
now be assigned to all words in the input. 

end_hook=compare_cgn

can be used to evaluate the postag output with respect to the postags
given in the Treebank.

command 
|: t_cgn 
gives the list of postags for the current sentence as
provided in the Treebank. Similar for
|: t_cgn Key
for the sentence with that key.

the command
|: cgn
provides the part-of-speech tags of the current parsed object. Similarly,
|: cgn ObjNo
gives the part-of-speech tags for that specific object.

* now provides CGN/D-COI/LASSY-like part-of-speech tags. If you want a
tagger, use "end_hook=postags". Also note the command "postags Obj" on
the command line interface, to see the postags of object number
Obj. The postags are available in XML-output as the value of the
attribute "postag". As in Lassy, the information in the postag is
broken up in smaller pieces, redundantly, in separate XML-attributes
as well.  For some cases, the postag output may still be missing
(e.g., "fixed parts" don't get postags assigned).

* fluency and parse-disambiguation model are now "multi-domain" 
  models. The flag "application_type" can be used to inform the
  models which domain is current. Default: "news". Other known
  domains are "qa" for questions, "ovis" for Ovis data.

* skips: do not count the number of skipped tokens, but the number
of skips (multi-word-skips only count as a single skip)

* many minor changes in lexical lookup, to be more robust against very
long gargage inputs

* boost library is now a new dependent of Alpino - earlier, the relevant Boost 
files were part of the Alpino distribution itself. Thus, you may need to install
Boost first, if you want to use Alpino!

* "of" now also is alsof_complementizer and modifier-complementizer

* improved efficiency of longest match checking. In one (very rare) case,
this reduced parsing time from 3 minutes to 4 seconds.

* new options:

  -init_dict    initialize all dictionaries
  -init_dict_p   ,,                          for parsing
  -init_dict_g   ,,                          for generation

* support for threads (SWI)

* support for fork (SWI + SICStus)
cf. Makefile.start_server and webdemo.py for examples.

=====================================================================================

* grammar:
  don't allow extraposition of VP via exs from attributive adjectives

* grammar:
  pp's of adjectives are now selected with extraposition, to allow for
  inherited pp's as in 'gepaard gaande met'

  extraposition of AP out of NP, only if there is a comma to reduce
  increase of search space
  "de enige producten waarvoor een prijs geldt , uitgedrukt in Europese rekeneenheden"

* renamed many module names, so that most names are readily understood
  to be part of Alpino:

  hdrug_...
  alpino_...

  remaining modules without such a prefix:

  derivbank
  corpusreader
  pro_fadd
  zlib

===========================================================================

* Alpino/Hdrug can now be loaded as a library in whatever "master" module,
and everything (including GUI) should still work!

===========================================================================

* UTF8 encoding used and expected throughout! 

===========================================================================

* port for SWI PROLOG! with help from Jan Wielemakers.

===========================================================================

* new XML attribute for MWU nodes: mwu_root which represents the root
  of the mwu. Useful to treat "ter zake" and "terzake" identical, etc. Also
  useful (and motivated by) generation.

* triples output will, by default, first undo MWU.
  If you don't want this, use triples_undo_mwu=off

* much improved version of generator. Still with limitations.

* initial version of generator. Unusable still.

* construction of derivation tree of PP's is now fully monotonic (in particular
for cases where NP is not obj1, but pobj1 or se) (to facilitate generation)

* changed treatment of mexs and imexs, so that MODS are properly [] if
there are none (to facilitate generation)

* there now is a Windows version

* the perl script for named entity classification is no longer required
(to facilitate the Windows port of Daniel de Kok)

* CVS ==> SVN

* coordination root-whq

* voor-PP as obj2

* short questions with modifier
  "wanneer niet"

* dp dp dp "dit allemaal omdat"

* locative adverbs now always can act as postnp adverbs

* many Flemish words/expressions (after some initial error mining of
Mediargus data)

* added treatment of OP-infinitives 
  "de dijk staat op doorbreken"

* changed treatment of UIT-infinitives: back to CGN analysis (VC)
  "uit vissen"

* treatment of pre-CP modifiers "een uur voordat de wedstrijd begon"

* treatment of pre-PP modifiers "een uur voor de wedstrijd"

* "(niet) meer/minder dan/als" NUM now treated as MWU modifier

* preposition(mod_sbar)
  "van toen ik drie jaar oud was"
  "voor als ik jarig ben"

* coordinations such as "zowel de linker- als de rechteroever

* wh-questions allow wh "in situ" "ik wil weten wie waarvoor verantwoordelijk
is"

* short relatives: "drie mensen raakten gewond [van wie drie ernstig]

* better feature selection: better and smaller disambiguation model; perhaps
not better for cdb

* mod_postposition does no longer require case=obl ("ikzelf uitgezonderd")

* nominalized comparatives can take ME

* complementizer(np) can modify nouns

* adjective "waard" takes obj1, not me.

* some verbs which were both refl and transitive, now only are
  transitive

* year's are now n rather than np
  'een mooi 1999' 'in 1998 , hij was toen elf , ...'

* predm + wh. "met z'n hoevelen komen jullie?
              "als welk personage wilt u terugkomen na uw dood?"

  also allow als+NP +wh

* "PP thuis" no longer annotated as "thuis" being a modifier of PP, but of
  NP. "bij ons boven" "bij ons in de buurt"

   added various locatives as postn_adverbs...

* meta notation [ @mwu ... ] to indicate that a sequence of words is a
multi-word-unit. The effect is, that any competing lexical categories are
removed. If Alpino does not recognize the sequence of words as a lexical 
category, then nothing happens (perhaps use the @postag notation in that
case).

* -veryfast: uses prefix filter. Now is the default for the
binary version. Should be a pleasant surprise for most users
that the parser now is much faster!!

* -veryfast: uses fourgram-guides, and parse_candidates_beam=500.
Comparison with -fast: drop in accuracy of 1% (90% -> 89%), but
four times faster. Is very sensitive to changes in grammar, though,
but this should only matter for me ;-)

* lexical analysis: redo lexical analysis with larger pos_tagg_n
  value in case of words that lose all their categories; 

* guides now based on four years training data and fourgrams; 
no longer use filter_frames_aggressively

* allow more comma's/dashes in coordination

* allow short question as conjunct "wie komt er en wie niet"

* allow short question with vp[psp]

* allow adv_predm as well to the right of verb-cluster

* topic-drop: only if nform=norm

* allow PPs and CPs that have : instead of complement (for Wikipedia)

* now treats DP [NP, omdat ...]

* now treats wees/weest with subject "weest u maar blij"...

* now treats "hoe het zover *is* kunnen komen"

* now treats first-person subjunctive "ik moge u erop wijzen" (for
Europarl)

* now treats extraposed PREDM

* now treats "ik wil beginnen met te zeggen ..." (for Europarl)

* verb-second is now treated by using a global-variable mechanism. Motivated
  by the desire to treat coordinations of vgapped VPs. So these are
  now allowed.

* rules max_wh_adv_* generalized to allow non-adv first daughters

* Barbara found a mistake in the T2/Makefile for computing
  CA-score. Is now ok.

* parse_candidates_beam default value for -fast has changed from 1000
  to 3000 because of increased efficiency. So we trade some of that efficiency 
  for increased accuracy.

* end_hooks frames and leftcorners are now written to standard error
  output, rather than standard output, because of incomprehensible
  problem because of which standard output sometimes unexpectedly
  stopped producing output (after parser timed out)

* end_coord(pp_loc_adverb,conj) rule is removed, because "in A en
  elders" is now PP coordination because:

* treat semi-er pronoun "elders". Is a saturated preposition now,
  which selects post-p "vandaan".

* only allow certain frames for aux_simple (zijn) arguments. Similarly for
  aci_simple (hebben).

* forbid indefinite nominalizations as objects for verbs that (in
  other frame) select infinitival vc/vp.

* for multiple orderings in subcat lists, only allow non-default ordering
in case objects are not topicalized and passivized.

* forbid cleft-vp's in contexts where subject is ignored. Similarly, often
  forbid special nforms for such subjects.

* added sentences to extra. "Dat/dit heeft het ministerie vandaag bevestigd" 
in the hope that parser picks up on the intended reading.

* treebank: removed UNKNOWN pos-values, and some other mistakes found by
  dtchecks

* many speed improvements - due to changes in argument_realization &tc, 
  where we employ more delayed evaluation. Also, changed inheritance of
  complements of raising and ACI verbs, by allowing certain elements 
  (refl, er, compl-pp) to be skipped. Same as for subject. Quite elegant!

  so we can now analyze 'omdat wij daarop de kinderen niet laten wachten'

  average parse times on cdb drops from 40 to less than 20 sec/sents.

* only do er-inheritance in sentences with variant of er

* wappend: counter counts back rather than up

* vp arguments etc: keep track of +/- cleft. Also, often require 
  that (unexpressed) subject has nform=norm. *Hij slaapt om te regenen

* lex_types: het_subj_or_topicalize delay choice of opt_het vs. obl_het

* change analysis of "gelegen liggen" and "gelegen zijn"

* more disjunctions in fixed subcat frames with special rules, to reduce
  spurious ambiguities

* repaired bug in mouse button <2> press in parse widget

* special passive frame for pseudo passive verbs such as 
  "staan, zitten, ..." which do not allow impersonal passive

* nonp_pred frame for adjectives

* rules: new rule for DP[ADV ADV]

* filter_tag: check that there is potential te-verb with appr HZ

* unknowns: make sure all-capital word forms receive correct surface form

* unknowns: recognize more verbs in context of "te"

* removed "trick" in lc.pl to reduce spurious ambiguities, because it 
  does not always work. Result: more spurious ambiguities :-(

* pos_tagger: added "offline" mode for Yan's experiments

* hdrug: added default output / medium

* removed obsolete code (probably no longer working anyway) cgn_tag, 
  universal_tag, thistle, ldplayer, dtrestore, dtedit

* much faster -veryfast option. Accuracy drops a bit further. To give you
  some idea, on the cdb corpus, the normal mode of operation (-fast) would
  require about 40 seconds per sentence, for an accuracy of over 89%.  With
  -veryfast, accuracy drops to about 85%. However, parsing takes only about
  4 seconds per sentence.

* treatment of er_nouns has changed, they now always start out as loc_adverbs,
  except for er which starts as er_vp_adverb

* speed improvements (no_memo for v2_vp, better linking, particles not always
  surviving; me arguments of comparatives of restricted subn...)

* in xml dump, new attribute 'sense' which combines some aspects of root
  and subcat

* new feature (auxiliary distribution technique) to improve accuracy somewhat,
  z_f2

* modified topicalized verb-clusters, now also allow some other vforms
  "Helemaal uitsluiten wil ik het niet" "Niet ontkend kan worden dat ..."

* allow questions with topic-drop. "Vindt u niet erg?"

* allow more tags in slash-compounds

* efficiency: don't even consider verbs with particles/fixed that do not
  occur in the input string

* nucl-sat structure where sat is a question "als ik vraag of je komt, kom
  je dan?"

* further sub-type of strong/weak pronouns, to allow for certain weak
  pronouns to occur as predc "was het wat? het was me wat. wordt het wat?
  hij denkt dat hij heel wat is"

* nominalizations: allow passive nominalizations as in 
  "uitgeschakeld worden is een ramp". Note these require inverted
  word order

* much improved/changed unknowns.pl. Sequences of unknown/foreign words now
  are treated as proper-names, rather than nouns. Listed a number of such
  frequent terms as proper names in Lexicon/misc.pl

* allow right-node-raising in PP, as in "het analyseren van en varieren op NP"

* enig(e) is ambiguous det/num and mod/adj
  
  enige "er is er maar 1" => adj/mod   "als enige"   "de enige"
  enige "leuke"           => adj/mod   "een enige plaat!"
  enige "some"            => num/det   "enige bezwaren"

* hstem now also for nominalizations. Eg:
  "we hebben er geen omkijken meer naar"

* "uit eten gaan" "uit vissen zijn". According to CGN, these are VC 
complements. We disagree, and assign LD role. Clearly, the "uit V" phrase
is not a verbal complement. It occurs where directional LD complements
can occur, and it can be passivized.

Ik stuur hem uit eten
Hij werd uit eten/bedelen gestuurd

* DIFFERENT CODING feature "rightx"
  to disallow extraposition from TAG to the right of NUCL in cases such as:
   "Hij vertelde_i ons : ik ga niet vanavond_i"

* DIFFERENT CODING separate rule for adjectives selecting NP depending
if the NP is OBJX or ME. In the latter case, no modification is allowed
between ME and HD.

* NEW CONSTRUCTION comparative-phrase without comparative 
  "zo snel ik kan"
  "zoveel je wilt"

also allows extraposition of such modifiers
  "ik heb gerend zo hard (als) ik kon"

analysis of "zoveel" as a relative has now been removed

* ANNOTATION in questions, most "Wat is NP?" is now analysed in a way that establishes
that "Wat" is the predc. In contrast, "Wie is NP?" is mostly analysed with
the "Wie" as su.

* NEW CONSTRUCTION allow sbar complementizers with measure/tmp NPs
"twee dagen voordat ..."
"elke keer als ..."

* NEW CONSTRUCTION allow more TAG in between DP DP
   Jammer hè , dat hij niet komt
   Geweldig hè , hij komt !
   Mooi hè , dat wereldrecord
   Ik vertrok hè , het was al laat

* ANNOTATION "als" and "zoals" now always are treated as complementizers projecting a
cmp/body structure. This is in accordance with ANS.
This also includes cases formely treated as PC (==> PREDC)

* BUG FIX new treatment of skippables (cf below) leads to bugs in parser, if
subsumption check is used for equivalent items. Now the subsumption
check is replaced by variant check. This is correct, but slower.
The incorrect version sometimes lead to a situation where the parser
did not produce a parse at all!

* NEW CONSTRUCTION sv1 modifier with sbar complement
   We moeten opschieten , willen we dat we op tijd komen

* NEW CONSTRUCTION now names are allowed as APPOS of other names, as long as they have the 
same NE-class. NE-class is used only for names that are listed in the
dictionary

* NEW CONSTRUCTION R-PP with modal_adverb
    er pal tegenover ...

* DIFFERENT CODING treatment of (optional) het in sbar-subj construction has changed, to
limit spurious ambiguities

* ANNOTATION "geen .. meer" in NP is no longer treated with "meer" modifiying "geen".
In most cases, "meer" is analyzed as a VP modifier. Cf. 
        *geen geld meer heb ik

* MAJOR DIFFERENCE treatment of quotes and other skippables. Skips are only allowed for
histories if no history is possible without that number of skips. Therefore,
expected skippables (brackets, quotes) are now more often introduced by
rule.

* NEW CONSTRUCTION Flemish inversion in v-cluster
    In Vlaanderen zou je kunnen opgebeld worden 
    In Vlaanderen zou hij kunnen te vinden zijn
    In Vlaanderen zou hij kunnen aan het zwerven zijn

* various minor changes to reduce spurious ambiguities

(begin of D-COI)

dependency structures
---------------------

DONE - all words have a node (also those nodes not taking part in analysis) as in CGN
DONE - now also assigns DLINK relation as in CGN
DONE - id for each node
DONE - version for each tree
DONE - "rangtelwoorden" are now mod as in CGN
DONE - no more mwu, begin=end+1 as in CGN
DONE - analysis of 'te-V' as in CGN
DONE - top element is now called 'alpino_ds' rather than 'top'

- cat for each (?) node (at least NP's, PP's, ADVP's and AP's)

- add option to construct more elaborated features (for cat, as for pos),
  e.g. agreement on NP-nodes.

Motivatie voor resterende verschillen tussen CGN en D-COI
---------------------------------------------------------

1. wat betreft obj1/vc:

* in CGN worden alle "groepsvormende" vp complementen VC. OK.   
* daarnaast worden aan werkwoorden zoals "dwingen" die een (om)-te
  complement nemen, maar niet groepsvormend zijn, en wel een NP obj1
  hebben de VC rol toegekend.
* Voor andere werkwoorden die niet groepsvormend zijn maar wel een (om)-te
  complement nemen, wordt label OBJ1 gebruikt.

Dit vind ik "minder geslaagd". Want:
- werkwoorden die soms wel/soms niet groepsvormend zijn zoals "proberen"
  moeten dan soms OBJ1/soms VC toekennen. Maar je kunt niet altijd aan
  de syntax zien of er groepsvorming optreedt:

     .. omdat hij probeert te slapen

  dit introduceert dus flauwe ambiguiteiten.

- werkwooren die soms wel/soms niet OBJ1-NP nemen worden op vergelijkbare
  manier hybride:

     .. omdat wij jullie helpen [ VC de straat schoon te houden ]
     .. omdat wij        helpen [ OBJ1 de straat schoon te houden ]

  terwijl je toch zou verwachten dat in beide gevallen de rol van de VP
  dezelfde is?
Om deze problemen te vermijden luidt het voorstel: VP complementen krijgen
ALTIJD de relatie VC en nooit de relatie OBJ1.



Voor finiete zinscomplementen is een vergelijkbare redenering op te zetten,
die wellicht iets minder overtuigend is. Ook bij finiete zinscomplementen
(die dus in CGN altijd OBJ1 worden) lijkt het soms mogelijk een "echte"
NP OBJ1 te hebben, die ook weer optioneel kan zijn:


ik bel wel even of hij komt
ik bel hem wel even of hij komt
ik werd gebeld of ik kwam

(idem voor "mailen", "verzoeken" (in hedendaags NL), "vragen", "waarschuwen")
Het voorstel is dan ook om ook finiete zinscomplementen het label VC toe te
kennen.

Merk op dat een transformatie van "oude" naar "nieuwe" representaties
betrekkelijk eenvoudig is: alle OBJ1 die oti, ti, smain zijn worden voortaan
VC.

Een verder argument om finiete en niet-finiete complementen dezelfde rol 
toe te kennen ligt in de observatie dat een hoofd vaak een zinsdeel-achtig
complement vereist, maar dat dit complement zowel een finiete als een 
niet-finiete zin kan zijn.
