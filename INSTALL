* you *need* to use the UTF-8 language environment. This is, because there
is some internal communication between Prolog and the foreign language 
interface which at the moment only works under this locale.

* in order to build/use the SICStus version, you need to set the following
SICStus Prolog variables:
export SP_CTYPE=utf8
export SP_CSETLEN=212

* you need to set the ALPINO_HOME environment variable to the
directory that contains the Alpino stuff

This should be it.

You may need to install additional packages, e.g. the boost library 
(is mostly part of your setup anyhow).


==========================================================================

potential issues:

* tcl/tk problems:

  - make sure you have the tcl/tk dynamic libraries installed, typically
    the files you need are
      /usr/lib/libtk8.4.so
      /usr/lib/libtcl8.4.so

  Gerlof Bouma reports that he had to create symbolic links
      /usr/lib/libtcl8.4.so.0 --> /usr/lib/libtcl8.4.so
      /usr/lib/libtk8.4.so.0 --> /usr/lib/libtk8.4.so


if you have tcl/tk 8.4 installed, but you get an error that no
usable init.tcl could be found, then it may be the case that your
tcl and tk library scripts are not in /usr/lib/tcl8.4 and /usr/lib/tk8.4
but somewhere else. For instance, for Ubuntu these are located in
/usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.4 and /usr/share/tcltk/tk8.4. In such cases, define
the following environment variables to point to the right directory, e.g.:

export TCL_LIBRARY=/usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.4
export TK_LIBRARY=/usr/share/tcltk/tk8.4


* error:

Resource error: insufficient memory

This sometimes appears to happen during startup, even if the system has 
enough memory. Try again (even 3 or 4 times) seems to solve this weird issue. 


* treebank tools

  for the treebank tools you need at least the following libraries:
      libxml2
      libxslt and libexslt
      libpopt
      libz


you will find the relevant scripts in the Alpino/bin directory

====================================================================

* if you want to re-compile from sources:

  be prepared for some work....


  - make sure you have latest SICStus 3 installed, including the 
    tcl/tk libraries. Alpino is not compatible with SICStus 4. 

  - make sure you have latest version of Jan Daciuk's s_fsa tools
    ftp://ftp.pg.gda.pl/pub/software/xtras-PG/fsa/fsa_current.tar.gz

  - make realclean

  - [optional] edit Makefile.defs
               edit Hdrug/Makefile.defs
    for any non-default settings

  - make
    make install

====================================================================

  - to build Alpino on Mac OS X or Windows, set the 'PLATFORM'
    variable to 'darwin' or 'windows' respectively in Makefile.defs

  - building Alpino on Windows requires Visual Studio 2005
