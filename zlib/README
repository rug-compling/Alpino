sics-zlib - Simple Sicstus zlib module
======================================
DaniÃ«l de Kok <me@danieldk.eu>

Introduction
------------

sics-zlib provides a very simple interface to zlib. Currently it only contains
the functionality that I need, but more may be added in the future.

Compilation
-----------

Requirements

- Sicstus Prolog 3.12.x (4.x.x is untested!)
- A decent C compiler

Execute 'make' in the source directory.

Usage
-----

The following predicates are provided:

 zlib_compress(+UncompressedByteList,-CompressedByteList)
 zlib_compress(+UncompressedByteList,+Level,-CompressedByteList)
 zlib_compress_term(+Term,-CompressedByteList,-UncompressedLength)
 zlib_compress_term(+Term,+Level,-CompressedByteList,-UncompressedLength)
 zlib_uncompress(+CompressedBytesList,+UncompressedLength,-UncompressedByteList)
 zlib_uncompress_term(+CompressedByteList,+UncompressedLength,-Term)

It is up to the caller to keep the length of the uncompressed byte list
for uncompression.

To give an example, the predicate test_compress/0 is always true:

 test_compress :-
    atom_chars(abababababababababababababababab,U),
    length(U,NU),
    zlib_compress(U,C),
    zlib_uncompress(C,NU,U).

Todo
----

- Stream I/O
- gzip format support

This module is covered by the zlib license.
