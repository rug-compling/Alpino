1. get Jan Daciuk's s_fsa and fadd tools, and install those

s_fsa:
http://www.eti.pg.gda.pl/~jandac/fsa.html

in the s_fsa/Makefile, you need to comment out the following
options from the definition of CPPFLAGS:

-DSORT_ON_FREQ
-DNEXTBIT
-DDUMP_ALL
-DGENERALIZE

this enforces that fsa_build creates a perfect hash key for words, which
is order preserving (to check alphabet ordering of words, it suffices
to compare the perfect hash keys (which are integers)). This is assumed
by the suffix array implementation, for obvious reasons of efficiency.



fadd:
http://www.eti.pg.gda.pl/~jandac/fadd.html

2. edit the FADD variable in the Makefile, check the other parts of the
Makefile

3. run 'make'

4. there are Examples/
