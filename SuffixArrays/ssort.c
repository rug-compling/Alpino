	Suffix sort
	Peter M. McIlroy
	M. Douglas McIlroy

Prototype
	int ssort(int a[], int s[]);

Purpose
	Return in a[] a suffix array for the original
	contents of a[].  (The original values in a[]
	are typically serial numbers of distinct tokens
	in some list.)  Optionally return in s[] an
	array of shared lengths between adjacent sorted
	suffixes.

Precondition
	Array a[] holds n values, with n>=1.  Exactly k 
	distinct values, in the range 0..k-1, are present.
	Value 0, an endmark, appears exactly once, at a[n-1].
	Pointer s is 0 or points to an array of n elements.

Postcondition
	Array a[] is a copy of the internal array p[]
	that records the sorting permutation: if i<j
	then the original suffix a[p[i]..n-1] is
	lexicographically less than a[p[j]..n-1].

	If s is nonzero, its elements are filled in with
	"shared lengths": s[i] is the length of the agreeing
	prefixes of a[p[i-1]..n-1] and a[p[i]..n-1].
	s[0] is 0.

Return value
	0 success
	1 out of space; data unchanged
	2 bad data; data may be changed

Cost
	Sorting takes time O(n log m), where m is the longest
	duplicate (possibly overlapped) substring, and uses n words
	of temporary memory.  There are at most log n passes,
	each involving essentially 5 serial and 6 random
	traversals of size-n arrays (a[] and p[]).  Shared
	lengths cost an extra n words of temporary memory;
	for time cost see comment with function shared() below.

	A tradeoff desribed after step (3) below saves
	about 20% in time at the cost of another n words.

Terminology
	"The h-gram at a[i]" is the string a[i], a[i+1], ...,
	a[i+h-1], with subscripts taken mod n, except that
	when h=0 the "0-gram" at a[i] is a[i].  (More succinctly,
	the h-gram at a[i] is a[i], ..., a[i+max(h,1)-1].)
	"The h-successor of the h-gram at a[i]" is the h-gram
	at a[i+h].  
	
Method
	Order 2h-grams by doing steps (1)-(5) below
	for h = 0, 1, 2, 4, ...  Because of the unique endmark,
	ordering n-grams (or longer grams) is exactly the same as 
	ordering the suffixes of a[].

	This is a fillip on radix sort.  The i-th stage of a
	traditional radix sort distributes on the i-th "character"
	counting from the right of the keys, thus arranging the keys
	so that their i-character suffixes are in lexicographic order.
	Here, instead, we distribute on h-gram prefixes of 2h-grams,
	where h = 2^i, thus arranging 2h-grams in order.  Each 
	h-gram is coded into one element of a[].
	This is possible within a constant word width because
	there are only n h-grams for any h.  With 2^i-grams being
	placed in order at stage i, and each stage taking time O(n),
	sorting is complete after log n stages for a total
	time of O(n log n).

	The method for shared lengths is given with the
	shared-length code far below.

History
	The general radix-sorting notion is due to Manber and
	Myers, SODA '91, who used a big-endian radix sort.  They
	also made the observation that by cleverly multiplexing
	uses of the two arrays, one can get by with O(1) extra
	space beyond arrays a[] and p[].  The circular-array idea,
	which greatly simplifies the program, is due to P. McIlroy.
	Steps (1) and (2) below are based on M&M's method for
	the first cycle (h=0); they do something entirely different
	for the h-gram doubling cycles and develop in a[] the
	inverse of permutation p[].  

	The state of the art has improved since this code was
	written.  A variant developed independently by (at least)
	Larssen at Lund, Sadakane at Tokyo and Quinlan at Bell Labs
	is several times as fast; see Larssen and Sadakane 
	LU-CS-TR:99-214, Dept. of CS, Lund Univ. Sweden.

Data used in the sort
	a[]   array of h-gram codes.
	al[]  linked-list area, overlaid on a[].
	p[]   permutation.
	pl[]  list heads, overlaid on p[].
	s[]   array of shared lengths (optional).
	q[]   tree of bucket refinements, for calculating s[].
	ORIG  mark at the end of lists, originally on p[].
	BUCK  mark at start of "buckets", stretches of p[]
	      that point to identical codes in a[].

	Were the overlaid arrays pulled apart, the algorithm would
	simplify only slightly, mainly by dropping the inner loop from
	steps (1) and (2).

Description of steps, except for optional shared lengths

(0)	(0a) Initialize p[] to contain the identity permutation.
	(0b) Place mark ORIG on every element of p[].

State before step 1
	Each element a[i] encodes the h-gram at a[i].
	The h-grams are coded 0,..,k-1 in increasing
	lexicographic order.  When h>0, permutation p[] 
	lists h-grams in lexicographic order: if i<j then
	a[p[i]] <= a[p[j]].  When h=0, p[] contains
	the input order 0,..,n-1.

(1)	Construct in al[] linked lists of like-valued
	codes in a[] ordered in reverse of the order
	of their h-successors as given by p[].
	(Done by iterating over elements of a[] in p[]-order
	and operating on their h-predecessors.)

	Place in pl[j] the head of the list of elements with
	value j.  Thus, if a[7]=a[3]=a[9]=2, and these
	elements were visited in this order according to p[],
	then pl[2]=9, al[9]=3, al[3]=7.  The list is developed
	by pushing previous contents of pl[j] onto the list.
	In particular the original content of pl[j] (which
	was p[j]) gets pushed to the end of the list (al[7]
	in the example), still bearing the mark ORIG.  The mark
	serves both to note the end of the list and to flag the
	fact that this element contains a quantity of a different
	kind.

	During step (1), a[] contains three kinds of data:
	unprocessed elements of a[], list links of al[]
	and list ends, marked ORIG, that contain original
	data from p[].  p[] contains two kinds of data:
	elements of p[], marked ORIG, and elements of pl[].

	The elements of p[] that have been displaced by pl[] 
	are retrieved by chasing the lists; this is done by
	a for loop.  Each list will be chased at most once in
	step (1) and once in step (2) and the total size of
	all lists will never exceed n, so the overhead of list
	chasing is at most linear in n.

State before step (2)
	Array a[] has been wiped out and replaced by
	the lists of al[], which together with pl[] give
	exactly the same information.  The first k elements
	of p[] are occupied by pl[] and the remaining elements
	are occupied by ORIG-marked elements of p[].

(2)	Make p[] point to the (former) elements of a[]
	in order of increasing value.  This is done in reverse:
	biggest values first, and for each value running out the
	list created in (1), which is already in reverse order.
	New values fill in the size-n array p[] from the top,
	while the size-k array pl[] of list heads shrinks
	toward the bottom.  Because no list is empty, the 
	two uses of p[] cannot collide.

	Place mark BUCK at each bucket start, namely the
	element of p[] last transferred from each list.

State before step 3
	Permutation p[] lists h-grams in lexicographic order.
	It is bucketed by h-grams.  Within each bucket h-grams
	are ordered by their h-successors.

(3)	Reconstruct codes in a[] from the buckets.  The
	element of a[] pointed to from the first bucket is 0;
	the elements pointed to from the second bucket are 1;
	and so on.

	This step would be unnecessary if al[] did not share
	storage with a[].  Then steps (2) and (4) could
	be combined.

State before step 4
	Permutation p[] is as before step 3, and code array
	a[] is as before step 1.

(4)	Refine buckets by values of h-successors in a[] by
	placing a BUCK mark on each p[i] where the h-successors
	of a[p[i]] and a[p[i-1]] differ.

State before step 5
	Array p[] holds an ordered, bucketed list of 2h-grams.

(5)	Recode a[] according to the new buckets, exactly as
	a[] was reconstructed in step (3).  Count the
	buckets to determine a new value of k.  If k==n, every
	bucket is a singleton and sorting is complete.


Bad input
	Code that invokes finish() is solely defensive.  It
	could be dropped if you like to live dangerously.

/* shareda.c: shared lengths for suffix arrays by ancestor tree

	a[] temporary space, used for pointers to containing buckets
	n, p[], s[], h as in ssort()
	q[] tree of bucket heads

	Array q holds a tree of bucket heads.  Initially q[0]
	is 0 and q[i] = -1 for i>0.  For each new bucket i
	created in the current pass, q[i] is (notionally)
	made to point to the previous bucket, j.  The shared
	length between the i-1st and i-th smallest suffix
	is stored in s[i].  The shared length between two
	arbitrary buckets is the minimum of the stored
	shared lengths on the paths to their nearest common
	ancestor (excluding that ancestor).

	For efficient search, paths are compressed by making
	each bucket point to the next bucket on the path to
	the root with a strictly smaller stored shared length.  
	This may change the identity of the nearest common
	ancestor, but does not affect shared lengths.

Cost
	There are 3 serial passes and 1 random pass over
	size-n arrays per call, plus the inner loops of steps
	(2) and (3), each of which is executed n times fpr
	each call of ssort().  The asymptotic worst case has
	not been analyzed, however the code has always been
	seen to be at least as fast as a guaranteed O(n log n)
	method that takes twice as much code.  (That method
	keeps in element i of an integer array the minimum
	value of s[] over the largest aligned power-of-2
	interval beginning at i.)

(0)	On the first pass, with h=0, the shared length between
	buckets is zero, and every bucket bcomes a child of the
	root node, 0.

(1)	On subsequent passes the old bucket that each potential
	new bucket refines is remembered in a[].  Array a[]
	is ordered by substring places, while q[] is ordered
	by substring values.

	If the values placed in a[] were kept in another array,
	the loops of shared() could be combined with loops of
	lssort().

(2)	When an h-gram bucket is split, the shared lengths between 
	adjacent subbuckets is h+u, where u is the shared length
	between the h-successors that differed (causing the split).
	To find u, we locate the nearest common ancestor.

	The common ancestor is found by searching the path from
	the higher-numbered bucket, k1, until reaching a bucket
	whose number does not exceed that of the lower-numbered
	bucket, k0.  This method is justified by two observations.
	All the new subbuckets have strictly longer shared lengths
	than all the old buckets.  All the subbuckets of a
	bucket fall between the bucket head and its next higher
	numbered sibling.

(3)	After new buckets have been processed, the tree q is
	updated.  New buckets are recognized by having mark
	BUCK and q[i]<0.
