Hi,

this is version 1.4b (public release) of the CLIG extendible grapher for
Computational Linguistics. The manual1.tex file in the doc/ subdirectory
contains as section which explains the requirements for it to be installed.

If you have any questions, you can contact me over E-mail or look at my
homepage for my new phone number.

Enjoy!
