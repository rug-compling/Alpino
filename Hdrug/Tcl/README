The application-defaults file Hdrug.ad in this directory is 
always loaded at startup. If you want to change certain defaults
system-wide, change them here. Defaults on a per-user basis can
be defined in a file called Hdrug in a standard place, as determined by
the environment variables XUSERFILESEARCHPATH XAPPLRESDIR XFILESEARCHPATH
and the directories $HOME/lib/X11/app-defaults, 
/usr/local/lib/X11/-app-defaults and /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. 
These need only contain those options that differ from the ones defined 
in ./Hdrug.ad

Finally you can also have special defaults for different applications
constructed with Hdrug, depending on the value of the Tcl/Tk variable
HDRUG. For example you could define an application-defaults file
HdrugDemo in which all fonts have very large size. A certain
application will use these if at startup the Tcl variable is set to
HdrugDemo (the same variable determines title of the root window and
the iconname). The Tcl/Tk variable is automatically set if the
Prolog flag application_name is set.
