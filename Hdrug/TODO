-  <?=?>  seems to require that attribute *must* exist in order to succeed.
this is not nice.

- check in feature library whether an attribute that is defined for a subtype
  is not defined for a supertype...

doc's need more work...

DONE - have separate .po files for separate binary distributions (sigh..)

DONE - bug in ALE Hpsg grammar: `too much variables'

- hdrug_stats..
- DOCUMENTATION help_pred
  stats
- visualization libraries should produce strings first, to be sent to
  files later (a.o. to prevent dangling open files)
- these libraries should also better work as libraries for other
  programs (hdrug_clig is almost ok)
- document new hooks clicking 2,3 on obj button
DONE - further integrate clig. 



-  problem with clig: after you change any of the clig variables, you might
   need to restart the gui, otherwise strange behaviour of clig output
   results
