This grammar is written by G. van Noord (with help from Gosse
Bouma). It is a head-driven unification grammar for Dutch in which
powerful recursive lexical rules are used. The approach is desribed in
the paper `The Scope of Adjuncts and the Processing of Lexical Rules',
co-authored with Gosse Bouma, which appears in the Proceedings of
Coling 1994, Kyoto. A more elaborated paper is entitled `Dutch Verb
Clustering without Verb Clusters..
