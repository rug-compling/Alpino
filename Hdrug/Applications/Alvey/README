These are some of the files used for some of the experiments reported 
in my article in Computational Linguistics,
`Efficient and Robust Parsing with the Head-corner Parser'.

NOTICE: cf. the file README in the Anlt2 directory, concerning the
Alvey NL Tools, which states:

  These files were supplied by John Carroll, johnca@cogs.susx.ac.uk,
  and are derived from a version of the ALVEY Natural Language Tools. Current
  information about these ALVEY NL Tools is available at
  <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/NL/anlt.html>

REQUIREMENTS:

This package requires Hdrug 4 / SICStus 3.7.1. 

USAGE:

Make sure you have Hdrug. Edit the scripts sh, shg and shgm. These
scripts take three arguments, resp. the parser, the compiled grammar,
and the suite file, e.g.:

slow startup, no precompilation of grammar required:
% ../../hdrug -l start -flag grammar anlt2.conv load_grammar_mode=interpret

after precompilation (``make all''), you can do quick start-up with e.g.:
% ../../hdrug -l start load_grammar_mode=compile



FILES:

Anlt2: original Anlt grammar as I got it from John Carroll, second version

Makefile:

README:

anlt2.conv: interface between Alvey 2nd version grammar in Anlt2 and
the parser compilers.

anlt2.suite: The 100 longer test sentences as selected by John Carroll (used
in his ACL 94 paper).

anlt2_hc.pl: compiled Alvey2 grammar for _hc_ parser.

anlt2_hc_lc.pl: compiled Alvey2 grammar for _hc_ parser in left-corner mode.

anlt2_lc.pl: compiled Alvey2 grammar for _lc_ parser.

start.pl: declarations for Hdrug.

hc.pl: head-corner parser

hc_compile.pl: head-corner grammar compiler

lc.pl: left-corner parser

lc_compile.pl: grammar compiler for left-corner parser.
