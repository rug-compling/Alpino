	This simple Definite Clause Grammar for Dutch
	was written by Gertjan van Noord in order to 
	illustrate the semantic-head-driven generation
	algorithm. More specifically this grammar was 
	used to obtain the performance data of the
	semantic-head-driven generation algorithm as
	described in the paper `An overview of head-driven
	bottom-up generation'. This paper is published in
	a collection entitled `Current Research in Natural
	Language Generation' edited by Robert Dale, Chris
	Mellish and Michael Zock, Academic Press 1990.
