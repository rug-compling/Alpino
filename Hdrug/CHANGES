4.335  . time-out did not work once at least one solution was found

4.334  . escape % in strings from parse-widget
       . toplevel print options now applied in clig output of terms (long
         terms gave rise to memory crashes in tcl...)
       . menu_flag and hdrug_menu_flag: now ordered alphabetically - different interface
       . install: check if saved state is different before copying
       . faster creation of object buttons after (re)start_x

4.333  . distinguish failure and success status for parsing/generation
       . removed calls to trimcore/0 since they appeared to give rise
         to segm faults

4.332  . maximum geometry (for my new 24'' screen!) 1600x800
       . -suite Suite (shorthand for -flag suite Suite)

       . hdrug_cmdint: extra command  'l <keys>' list sentences with these
         keys)

         a lot of minor changes. 
       . compatible with (requires?) SICStus 3.9

         improvements/changes.

       . top-canvas: 2-ary variant with name of top-level widget
       . two new example applications, from Rob Malouf: stochastic
         context-free grammar, and stochastic attribute-value grammar.
       . simplified .po construction in Applications hierarchy, to
         build much faster. Hope this doesn't introduce any problems.

         this flag can be used to run a command *after* `hdrug' is
         initialized and *after* the application is initialized by
         hdrug_initialization/0. The value of the flag is called
         as a goal and all solutions are found using a failure-driven
         loop, after which the program terminates.

4.209  . SICStus 3.8.1

4.208  . added hook for action when clicking with 2 or 3 on

4.0.6  . bug in startup script (-script works again)

4.0.5  . help system moved into help.pl; Not quite finished yet. Want

       . bug in hdrug_cmdint which mis-treated commands solely consisting
         of Prolog variable
       . new library: hdrug_chart.pl for pretty printing of charts. 
         TO DO: alter ALE and SEM to use this.

4.0.1  . bitmaps work
       . added a few help-lines
       . Applications/Ale: added pretty printing of chart and chart items. Wow!


most important changes in 4.0.0
-------------------------------

- new: extendible treatment of command-line options
- command interpreter re-implemented, enhanced, simplified
- directory and file architecture simplified
- new: on-line help system; this is also used to generate parts of
  refman automatically
- new: reference manual, cf. directory Manual
- new: tkconsol (use tkconsol=on to try it out)
- new: active object button (number of object that is being shown is highlited
- simplified example applications; no separate scripts anymore, just type
  hdrug -l start
- new: allow test runs of generation, just like parsing. 
- TkTree Tcl/Tk is not used anymore (this was already altered in one of
  the last pre 4.0.0 versions).
- link-clause is gone; now uses multifile declarations for more commands,
  tree formats, portray, ..
- term expansion is gone. There is some support still in hdrug_util, in order
  to obtain user:user_clause/2 definitions (for visualization of your Prolog
  clauses). Use the flag user_clause_expansion.
- generic interface to the visualization commands by means of the 
  show/3 command. Simplified much of the interfaces of the visualization
  libraries.
- Alvey application added to Applications directory
- ALE application updated to version 3.1
- documentation is added to distribution
