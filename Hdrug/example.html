This section describes an example session of one of the applications
that comes with the standard Hdrug distribution (in the LexRules
directory). This is a small experimental parsing/generation system for
Dutch. Some of the underlying motivations for this system are
described in <a href="refs.html#coling94">van Noord and Bouma (1994)
      </a>. 

This application is started by the UNIX shell command <tt>hdrug -l
start</tt>. This results in the appearance of the
Hdrug widget, which looks like: 

<P>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="initial.png">
<P>
At the top of the widget we find a row of menu buttons (the MenuBar).
Below the row of buttons two large sub-widgets (the Canvases) are
placed. At the bottom we find a few buttons and a few labels (the
ButtonBar).  The labels indicate the current parser, generator and
top-category.
<P>
A simple command can be executed by selecting from the MenuBar the
item DEBUG followed by STATISTICS (luckily, most menu's will give rise
to more interesting actions).
<P>
Typically, a NLP system is tested by feeding it example sentences.
Let's suppose we want to parse the sentence `jan kust marie' (i.e. the
Dutch equivalent of John kisses Mary). We select PARSE-PARSE
SENTENCE. 
This gives rise to the following window:
<P>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="sentence.png">
<P>
 in which we can either select a sentence from a
list of given sentences, or we can type in a new sentence. In this
case we type in the new sentence `jan kust marie'.
In the Sicstus widget some information concerning the parse process is
displayed, such as the current value of the parser, the cputime it
takes to parse, and two abbrevations of the semantic representations of
the parse-results. Furthermore, two new buttons labelled 1 and
2 are placed on a row below the MenuBar. We will refer to this
row as the ObjectBar.
<P>
These two buttons refer to the two results of the parse command.
Pressing a button from the ObjectBar gives rise to a submenu,
indicating some actions we can undertake with the object.  For
example, selecting 1-VIEW-TK-TREE-D gives
rise to the parse tree of the object.  This parse-tree is placed
on the left canvas:
<P>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="parse-tree.png">
<P>
Note that the nodes of the parse-trees are buttons.  Pressing one of
the nodes of the parse-trees gives rise to a display of the
corresponding feature-structure in the right canvas. Alternatively, if
we have enabled the USE NEW CANVAS button at the bottom of the
screen, then such feature-structures will appear in a new separate
window. If we press the button dominating <tt> kust</tt>, we obtain the
following window:

<P>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="matrix.png">
<P>

Pressing the left mouse button on an attribute name hides the
corresponding value. Pressing the right mouse button on an attribute
name brings the corresponding value back on the screen.
Alternatively, we can select 2-VIEW-TK-TREE-Q. This also results in a
tree to be printed on the canvas, but this time the tree represents
the semantic structure of the second parse result. Playing around with
the other view possibilities will give you some idea of some of the
possibilities of Hdrug. For example, feature structures, trees and
Prolog terms can also be output via CLiG or via LaTeX in an Xdvi
window. And, of course, you can also get the output to appear in the
standard output window (ASCII art).
<P>
The viewing of trees and feature structures can also be combined. If
we ask for 2-VIEW-TK-TREE-MATRIX(SYN) then
we obtain the most spectacular form of output:
<P>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="matrixtree.png">
<P>
The current application not only can be used for parsing, but
also has a built-in generation component. Selecting
GENERATE-GENERATE LF gives rise to a dialog window in
which you can either type a logical form, or select one from the
existing set of logical forms. Selecting, for example, the logical
form <tt>kust(marie,jan)</tt>, gives rise to two generation results.
Again, these results are available for inspection thru the ObjectBar.<BR>
<P>
The TEST-SUITE menu contains a number of commands that are useful if
we are interested in a comparison of the behavior of a set of different
parsers. If we select TEST-SUITE-PARSER SELECTION then we
can indicate which parsers we want to compare. Initially all existing
parsers are `active'. 
Suppose that we want to compare only two of the
parsers, namely <tt>shift_reduce</tt> and <tt>right_chart</tt>. We can
achieve this by de-activating each of the other parsers one at the
time. 
<P>
We can now select TEST-SUITE-COMPARE PARSERS. Suppose we
want to compare the parsers on the sentence `de man die slaapt
slaapt' (the man who sleeps sleeps). 
This gives rise to all kinds of behavior in the Sicstus widget. In
effect Hdrug parses the sentence twice, using each of the active
parsers (the <tt> shift_reduce</tt> parser and the <tt> rcp3_dtrs</tt>
parser). For this sentence the latter parser is fifteen times faster.
<P>
Before we want to conclude that this result indicates that indeed the
latter parser is faster, we might want to have some more results. In
fact, we could decide to parse all of our sentences, and compare the
results of this test-suite. This can be achieved by selecting
TEST-SUITE-RUN TEST SUITE. Time for coffee. After some time
(depending on the financial situation of your employer) your patience
is rewarded and Hdrug has finished this laborious task. We can now
obtain some statistical information.
<P>
For example, we can select the option TEST SUITE-VIEW TEST
      RESULTS-TOTALS PER #words TK. This produces the window given
      here: 
<P>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="stat.png">
<P>

This shows that our test-suite is not yet large
enough and that both parsers are very slow (even if
these cputimes are measured on a 486 machine running Linux).
Also note that the line for the shift_reduce parser does not cover
the same portion of the x-axis as does the other parser. This is
because by default there is a time-out (that you can redefine) for
each sentence that is to be parsed. 
Once a parser has reached the time-out for a
sentence of length <b>n</b>, then Hdrug refuses to use this parser for
sentences longer than <b>n</b> (unless you alter another global
      variable). 

It is now somewhat more interesting to get the LaTeX
output, as this is organized in a different way. If we select
TEST SUITE-VIEW TEST RESULTS-TOTALS PER #words LATEX then we obtain
      the following table:
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img1.png">

<P>
Let us now take a look at the VIEW menu. This provides a
number of possibilities to view objects,  types and (Prolog)
predicates, as defined in the grammar files. For example, let's assume
we select the option VIEW-PREDICATE-LATEX-TEXT. 
We are prompted for a predicate name. Let's choose <tt>wdel/3</tt>. After a
short delay the Xdvi window now should look as follows:
<P>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img4.png"><BR> 
<P>
Note that you might have to click in the Xdvi window, to update
the view in the window. If you happened to quit the Xdvi application
before, you can restart it using the Prolog predicate <tt>xdvi/0</tt>.
<P>
As another example, let us now take a look at a tree oriented output
thru LaTeX. For this purpose, we select
the option VIEW-OBJECT-LATEX-TREE D.  We
are prompted for the  object number. If we select object 2, then
the Xdvi window will present the following:
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img5.png"><P>
<P>
As a final example we want to get a tree in LaTeX
format, of which the nodes are feature structures themselves. In order
to do this, we have to select the VIEW-OBJECT-LATEX-TREE-MATRIX E
option. This produces:
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img6.png">

<P>
Consider the option VIEW-LEXICAL HIERARCHY-TK
which presents the lexicon as a tree, indicating some
of the structure of the hierarchical lexicon. This huge tree is placed
on the canvas:
<P>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="lexicon.png">
<P>

Note that you can use the
middle mouse button to scroll the canvas more conveniently. Also note
that you can adapt the size of the canvas by dragging (with the left
mouse button) the border of the two canvases.
It is also possible to inspect the definition(s) of a lexical entry.
Selecting VIEW-LEXICAL ENTRY-LATEX-MATRIX
produces a dialog box asking for a specific lexical entry. Let's
assume we select the lexical entry `krant' (newspaper). This produces
the output:
