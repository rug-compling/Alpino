"
Hdrug is an environment to develop grammars, parsers and generators
for natural languages.  The system provides a number of visualisation
tools, including visualisation of feature structures, syntax trees,
type hierarchies, lexical hierarchies, feature structure trees,
definite clause definitions, grammar rules, lexical entries, chart
datastructures and graphs of statistical information e.g. concerning
cputime requirements of different parsers.  Visualisation can be
requested for various output formats, including ASCII text format, TK
Canvas widget, LaTeX output, DOT output, and CLiG output.

Extendibility and flexibility have been major concerns in the design
of Hdrug.  The Hdrug system provides a small core system with a large
library of auxiliary relations which can be included upon demand.
Hdrug extends a given NLP system with a command interpreter, a
graphical user interface and a number of visualisation tools.
Applications using Hdrug typically add new features on top of the
functionality provided by Hdrug.  The system is easily extendible
because of the use of the Tcl/Tk scripting language, and the
availability of a large set of libraries.  Flexibility is obtained by
a large number of global flags which can be altered easily to change
aspects of the system.  Furthermore, a number of hook predicates can
be defined to adapt the system to the needs of a particular
application.

The flexibility is illustrated by the fact that Hdrug has been used
both for the development of grammars and parsers for practical systems
but also as a tool to experiment
with new theoretical notions and alternative processing strategies.
Furthermore, Hdrug has been used extensively
both for batch processing of large text corpora, and also for
demonstrating particular applications for audiences of non-experts.

Hdrug is implemented in SICStus Prolog version 3, exploiting the
built-in Tcl/Tk library. The Hdrug sources are available free of
charge under the Gnu Public Licence copyright restrictions.

1.1 Interface

Hdrug provides three ways of interacting with the underlying NLP
system:
        * Using an extendible command interpreter.
        * Using Prolog queries.
        * Using an extendible graphical user interface (based on Tcl/Tk).

The first two approaches are mutually exclusive: if the command
interpreter is listening, then you cannot give ordinary Prolog
commands and vice versa. In contrast, the graphical user interface
(with mouse-driven menu's and buttons) can always be used. This
feature is very important and sets Hdrug apart from competing systems.
It implies that we can use at the same time the full power of the
Prolog prompt (including tracing) and the graphical user interface.
Using the command interpreter (with a history and alias mechanism) can
be useful for experienced users, as it might be somewhat faster than
using the mouse (but note that many menu options can be selected using
accelerators). Furthermore, it is useful for situations in which the
graphical user interface is not available (e.g. in the absence of an X
workstation).  The availability of a command-line interface in
combination with mouse-driven menu's and buttons illustrates the
*flexible* nature of the interface.

An important and interesting property of both the command interpreter
and the graphical user interface is *extendibility*. It is very
easy to add further commands (and associated actions) to the command
interpreter (using straightforward DCG syntax).  The graphical user
interface can be extended by writing Tcl/Tk scripts, possibly in
combination with some Prolog code. A number of examples will be given
in the remainder of this paper.

Finally note that it is also possible to run Hdrug without the
graphical user interface present (simply give the *notk* option
at startup). This is sometimes useful if no X workstation is available
(e.g. if you connect to the system over a slow serial line), but also
for batch processing.  At any point you can start or stop the
graphical user interface by issuing a simple command.

1.2 Visualisation

Hdrug supports the visualisation of a large collection of
data-structures into a number of different formats.

These formats include (at the moment not all datastructures
are supported for all formats. For example, plots of two dimensional
data is only available for Tk):

        * LaTeX
        * CLiG
	* DOT

The data-structures for which visualisation is provided
are:

* Trees. Various tree definitions can exist in parallel. For example,
the system supports the printing of syntax trees, derivation trees,
type hierarchy trees, lexical hierarchies etc. Actions can be
defined which are executed upon clicking on a node of a tree. New
tree definitions can be added to the system by simple declarations.

* Feature structures. Clicking on attributes of a feature-structure
implode or explode the value of that attribute.  Such feature
structures can be the feature structures associated with grammar
rules, lexical entries, macro definitions and parse results.

* Trees with feature structure nodes. Again, new tree definitions
can be declared. An example is
http://www.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/Hdrug/Manual/dt.png

* Graph (plots of two variable data), e.g. to display the
(average) cputime or memory requirements of different parsers.

* Tables.

* Prolog clauses.

* Definite clauses with feature structure arguments. This can be
used e.g. to visualise macro definitions, lexical entries, and
grammar rules (possibly with associated constraints).

1.3 Parser and Generator Management

Hdrug provides an interface for the definition of parsers and
generators.  Hdrug manages the results of a parse or generation
request. You can inspect these results later.  Multiple parsers and
generators can co-exist. You can compare some of these parsers with
respect to speed and memory usage on a single example sentence, or on
sets of pre-defined example sentences. Furthermore, actions can be
defined which are executed right before parsing (generation) starts,
or right after the construction of each parse result (generation
result), or right after parsing is completed.

1.4 Useful Libraries

Most of the visualisation tools are available through libraries as
well. In addition, the Hdrug library contains mechanisms to translate
Prolog terms into feature structures and vice versa (on the basis of a
number of declarations). Furthermore, a library is provided for the
creation of `Mellish' Prolog terms on the basis of boolean expressions
over finite domains. The reverse translation is provided too. Such
terms can be used as values of feature structures to implement a
limited form of disjunction and negation by unification.

A number of smaller utilities is provided in the library as well, such
as the management of global variables, and an extendible on-line help
system.
	  ").

help_info(class,flag,"Global Variables",
"

Hdrug manages a number of `global' variables.  A flag consists of a
ground key (the `global variable') and a value (arbitrary Prolog
term).  Flags can be set by means of command-line options,
command-interpreter commands, the Options menu, and directly by Prolog
predicates.

Global variables are passed on to Tcl/Tk. For this purpose there
exists a Tcl/Tk array variable, called `flag'. If the graphical user
interface is running, then this Tcl/Tk variable is automatically
updated when the Prolog flag is altered.
The predicate tk_flag/1 can be used to explicitly send the value of a
flag to Tcl/Tk.

").

help_info(class,option,"Command-line Options",
"When Hdrug is started, it first interprets the command-line
options. Command-line options are interpreted from left to right. The
following section lists the command-line options which are
standard. Each application possibly extends this list: this is defined
below.

Note that command-line options are interpreted *before*
application-specific initialization is performed. This is to allow
command-line options to have an effect on this initialization. Refer
to the hook predicate *hdrug_initialization* for application-specific
initialization.

Hdrug applications can extend the list of possible startup options by
adding definitions to the multifile predicate option/3. Short usage
information for such options can be defined with further definitions
for the multifile predicate usage_option/3. An an example, the
following definitions ensure that an option -rc File will reconsult
the file File:

        :- multifile option/3, usage_option/3.

        option(rc) --> [File], { reconsult(File) }.
        usage_option(rc,\"rc File\",\"File is reconsulted.\").



").

help_info(class,command,"Command Interpreter","

In principle there are three ways to interact with Hdrug:

       * SICStus Prolog Top-level
       * Command Interpreter
       * Graphical User Interface

The first two items are mutually exclusive: if the command interpreter
is listening, then you cannot give ordinary SICStus Prolog commands
and vice versa. The graphical user interface can be used in
combination with both the SICStus Prolog Top-level or the command
interpreter.

Prolog queries are given as ordinary Sicstus commands. This way of
interacting with Hdrug can be useful for low level debugging etc.
Using the command interpreter can be useful for experienced users, as
it might be somewhat faster than using the graphical user interface.


The command-interpreter features a history and an alias mechanism. It
includes a facility to escape to Unix, and is easily extendible by an
application.

The command interpreter is started by the Prolog predicate r/0 The
command interpreter command *p* halts the command interpreter (but
Hdrug continues).

Commands for the command interpreter always constitute one line of
user input. Such a line of input is tokenized into a number of *words
using spaces and tabs as separation symbols. The first *word* is taken
as the command; optional further words are taken as arguments to the
command. Each command will define certain restrictions on the number
and type of arguments it accepts.

Each word is treated as a Prolog atomic (either atom or integer, using
name/2).  In order to pass a non-atomic Prolog term as an argument to
a command, you need to enclose the word in the meta-characters {
and }. For example, the flag command can be used to set a global
variable. For example:

        16 |: flag foo bar

sets the flag *foo* to the value *bar*. As an other example,

        17 |: flag foo bar(1,2,3)

sets the flag *foo* to the Prolog atom 'bar(1,2,3)'. Finally,

        17 |: flag foo {bar(1,2,3)}

sets the flag *foo* to the complex Prolog term bar(1,2,3),
i.e. a term with functor bar/3 and arguments 1, 2 and 3.

Also note that in case the {,} meta-characters are used, then the
variables occurring in words take scope over the full
command-line. For instance, the parse command normally takes a
sequences of words:

        18 |: parse John kisses Mary

In other to apply the parser on a sequence of three variables, where
the first and third variable are identical, you give the command:

        19 |: parse {A} {B} {A}

The special meaning of the {,} meta-characters can be switched off
by putting a backslash in front of them. For example:

        53 |: tcl set jan \\{ piet klaas \\}
        =>  piet klaas

        54 |: tcl puts jan
        jan

The following meta-devices apply: All occurences of $word are
replaced by the definition of the alias *word*.  The alias command
itself can be used to define aliases:

        19 |: alias hallo ! cat hallo
        20 |: $hallo

so command number 20 will have the same effect as typing

        33 |: ! cat hallo

and if this command had been typed as command number 33 then
typing

        35 |: $33

gives also the same result.

Moreover, if no alias has been defined, then it will apply the last
command that started with the name of the alias:

        66 |: parse john kisses mary
        67 |: $parse

Both commands will do the same task.


It is possible to add commands to the command interpreter. The idea is
that you can define further clauses for the multifile predicate
hdrug_command/3.  The first argument is the first word of the command.
The second argument will be the resulting Prolog goal, whereas the
third argument is a list of the remaining words of the command (the
arguments to the command).

        :- multifile hdrug_command/3.

        hdrug_command(plus,(X is A+B, format('~w~n',[X])),[A,B]).

Relevant help information for such a command should be defined using
the multifile predicate hdrug_command_help/3. The first argument of
this predicate should be the same as the first argument of
hdrug_command. The second and third arguments are strings (list of
character codes). They indicate respectively usage information, and a
short explanation.

        :- multifile hdrug_command_help/3.
        hdrug_command_help(plus,\"plus A B\",\"Prints the sum of A and B\").


For example, consider the case where we want the
command *rx* to restart the Tcl/Tk interface. Furthermore, an
optional argument of `on' or `off' indicates whether the TkConsol feature
should be used. This could be defined as follows:

        hdrug_command(rx,restart_x,L):-
            rxarg(L).

        rxarg([on])  :- set_flag(tkconsol,on).
        rxarg([off]) :- set_flag(tkconsol,off).
        rxarg([]).

        hdrug_command_help(rx,\"rx [on,off]\",
             \"(re)starts graphical user interface with/without TkConsol\").

").


help_info(class,hook,"Interfacing Hdrug","

For an application to work with the Hdrug system, there are a number
of predicates you have to supply. Furthermore, you can extend the Hdrug
system with application-specific options. Finally, you can always
overwrite existing Hdrug definitions. In this chapter I discuss
the various possibilities.

Parsers and Generators

In Hdrug you can define any number of parsers and generators. A parser
and generator is identified by an atomic identifier. A parser is
declared by the following directive:

        :- hdrug_flag(parser(Identifier),on/off).

Similarly, a generator is declared by:

        :- hdrug_flag(generator(Identifier),on/off).

This defines a parser of generator and moreover tells Hdrug whether
this parser is active (on) or not (off).  Only if a parser is active,
it will be used in parser-comparison runs.  Not only should the application
define which parsers and generators exist, but usually it will also
define the `current' parser and generator.  This is achieved by
initializing the *parser* and *generator* flag.

        :- initialize_flag(parser,Identifier).
        :- initialize_flag(generator,Identifier).

Summarizing, there exist a number of parsers. A subset of those
parsers are active. One of the parsers is the current parser.

If a parser (generator) is defined, then there should be a module with
the same name which provides the following predicates. Note that only
the first one of these predicates, parse/1 or generate/1, is
obligatory. The others are not.

* parse/1;generate/1. This predicate is the predicate that does the
actual parsing (generation).  At the time of calling, the argument of
the parse/1 (generate/1) predicate is a term o(Obj,Str,Sem) where Obj
is a term in which the top-category is already instantiated.
Furthermore, part of the term might be instantiated to some
representation of the input string (in case of parsing if the
predicate phonology/2 is defined) or some representation of the input
logical form (in case of generation if the predicate semantics/2 is
defined). But note that the string and logical form are also available
(if instantiated) in the second and third argument of the o/3 term.

* count/0.This optional predicate is thought of as a predicate that
might produce some statistical information e.g. on the number of chart
edges built. Note that library(hdrug_util) contains predicates to
count the number of clauses for a given predicate.

* count/1. Similarly, but this time the argument should get bound to
some integer. The argument of this predicate determines the final
argument of the table_entry/6 predicate in test runs.

* clean/0. If the parser adds items, chart edges etc. to the database,
then this predicate defines the way to remove these again.


Top categories

Usually a grammar comes with a notion of a `start symbol' or `top
category'.  In Hdrug there can be any number of different top
categories. These top categories are Prolog terms. Each one of them is
associated with an atomic identifier for reference purposes. Each top
category is defined by a clause for the predicate top/2,
where the first argument is the atomic identifier and the second
argument is the top-category term. For example:

        top(s,node(s,_)).
        top(np,node(np,_)).

The flag `top_features' is used to indicate what the current choice
of top-category is. Usually an application defines a default value for
this flag by the directive:

        :- initialize_flag(top_features,Identifier).

The identifier relates to the first argument of a top/2 definition.

Strings and Semantics

The predicate semantics/2 defines which part of an object
contains the semantics (if any). For example, in an application
categories are generally of the form node(Syn,Sem). Therefore,
the following definition of semantics/2 is used:

        semantics(node(_,Sem),Sem).

The predicate is mainly used for generation. By default, the predicate
is defined as semantics(_,_).

In a similar way, the predicate phonology(Node,Phon) can be
defined. This is only useful for `sign-based' grammars in which the
string to be parsed is considered a part of the category. The default
definition is phonology(_,_).

The predicate extern_sem/2 can be used to define a mapping between
`internal' and `external' formats of the semantic representation. This
predicate is used in two ways: if a semantic representation is read
in, and if a semantic representation is written out. The first
argument is the external representation, the second argument the
internal one. The default definition is extern_sem(X,X).

Grammar compilation

Currently, the grammar menu contains four distinct options to
recompile (parts of) the grammar. It is assumed that if an application
is started, the grammars are already compiled. These options will thus
be chosen if the grammar has to be recompiled (e.g. because part of
the grammar has been changed).

The following four predicates have to be provided by the application.
If these predicates do not fulfill your needs, you can always extend
the grammar menu (cf. below), or even overwrite it (as in the Ale
application).

* compile_grammar/0 should recompile the whole grammar.

* reconsult_grammar/0 should recompile the whole grammar. If files
are to be loaded, then `reconsult' is used rather than `compile'. This
allows easier debugging.

* compile_grammar_file/1 should recompile the grammar file that is
its argument.

* reconsult_grammar_file/1 idem, but uses reconsult

Test-suites

A test suite consists of a number of Prolog clauses for the predicate
sentence/2, where the first argument is a unique identifier of that
sentence, and the second argument is a list of atoms; and clauses for
the predicate lf/2.  For example:

        sentence(a,[john,kisses,mary]).
        sentence(b,[john,will,kiss,mary]).
        lf(1,fut(kiss(john,mary))).
        lf(2,past(kiss(mary,john))).

The test suite might also contain a definition of the predicate
user_max/2.  This predicate is used to define an upper time limit,
possibly based on the length of the test sentence (the first
argument), for parsing that sentence in a test-suite run.  By default,
Hdrug behaves as if this predicate is defined as follows:

        user_max(L,Max) :-
             Max is 10000 + (L * L * 300).

Statistical information for each parse is preserved by the dynamic
predicate table_entry/6.
The arguments of this predicate
indicate:

* an atom (the unique identifier of the sentence)

* an integer (the length of the sentence)

* an integer (the number of parses of the sentence, i.e. the
degree of ambiguity)

* an atom (the name of the parser)

* an integer (the amount of milliseconds it took to parse the
sentence. In case of time-out the atom `time_out').

* a term (often used to indicate the number of chart-edges built).
It is determined by the count/1.

Extending the Graphical User Interface

It is easy to extend the Graphical User Interface for a specific
application. There are two predicates that you can define. The first
predicate, gram_startup_hook_begin/0 is called before loading of
hdrug.tcl, whereas the predicate gram_startup_hook_end/0 is called at
the end of the loading of this file.

Viewing Prolog Clauses

If you want to use Hdrug's built-in facilities to view Prolog clauses,
then it is neccessary that these clauses are accessible via the
predicate user_clause/2.  The arguments of this predicate are the head
and the body of the clause respectively. The reason that Hdrug does
not use the built-in clause/3 predicate, is that this predicate is
only available for dynamic clauses. ").

  [Ale] integrates phrase structure parsing, semantic-head-driven
  generation and constraint logic programming with typed feature
  structures as terms. This generalizes both the feature structures of
  PATR-II and the terms of Prolog II to allow type inheritance and
  appropriateness specifications for features and values. Arbitrary
  constraints may be attached to types, and types may be declared as
  having extensional structural identity conditions. Grammars may also
  interleave unification steps with logic program goal calls (as can
  be done in DCGs), thus allowing parsing to be interleaved with other
  system components. ALE was developed with an eye toward Head-Driven
  Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), but it can also execute PATR-II
  grammars, definite clause grammars (DCGs), Prolog, Prolog-II, and
  LOGIN programs, etc. With suitable coding, it can also execute
  several aspects of Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG).

"
The Hdrug widget
(http://www.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/Hdrug/Manual/ale1.png)
contains the following sub-widgets (from top-to-bottom).

* MenuBar. The MenuBar contains a number of menubuttons. Each of
these menu's is described below.

* ObjectBar. The ObjectBar is initially invisible. Once `objects' are
produced by a parser or generator these objects will be placed on this
bar.

* Two scrollable canvases. Each canvas is initially left blank but is
used for graphical output such as parse-trees, etc. You can scroll the
canvas using the scrollbars, but also using the middle mouse
button. The relative size of the canvases can be adapted by dragging
the border with the left mouse button, or with the file-enlarge left
canvas resp. enlarge right canvas commands.

* TkConsol. If the global variable tkconsol is on, then the
TkConsol widget treats standard input, standard output and error
output.

* ButtonBar. The ButtonBar contains three buttons that can be used to
change the value of the top category, the parser and the
generator. The current values of these are also listed next to the
corresponding buttons. The checkbox `new canvas' can be switched on in
order for the next graphical output to be directed to a seperate
window. Finally the rightmost button is a button that is added by manu
applications, and which functions as an `About' button.
").

help_info(gui,menubar,"The MenuBar",
"
* The File Menu. The file menu contains buttons of which the meaning is
rather straightforward. The first items can be used to (re)compile
grammar files. The detailed meaning is dependent on the application.

The `compile prolog file' button lets you choose a Prolog file
which will be compiled. The `reconsult prolog file' button
behaves similarly but reconsults the file. The `source tk/tcl file'
button can be used to source a Tcl/Tk file. The `halt' button
halts the application (really!).

The `enlarge left canvas' and `enlarge right canvas' buttons
adapt the relative size of the two canvases.

It is also possible to restart the application. This implies that the
graphical environment is restarted, but the application files are not
reconsulted. This is useful if you are adding/debugging parts of the
graphical interface. Use `restart x' to restart.  `quit x -
keep prolog alive' allows you to stop the interface, but continue
the Prolog session.

* The Debug Menu. The debug menu contains a few buttons that are
straightforward interfaces to the corresponding Prolog predicates. It
contains the options

        * nodebug
        * debug
        * remove spypoints
        * spy predicate
        * unspy predicate
        * statistics

* The Options Menu. The options menu provides an interface to the
global variables.

* The Parse Menu. The parse menu is a more interesting menu, although it
consists of only a single button.  Pressing this button will present a
dialog widget asking you for a sentence. You can either type in a new
sentence, or select one of the available test sentences. The available
sentences are the sentences that were previously parsed during the
current session, or that were listed in the test-suite, or that were
the result of generation in the current session. The sentence you type
or select will be parsed using the current parser, and the current top
category. Some statistical output will be presented on standard
output. For each parse result a numbered object is created. Each
object is visible as a button on the ObjectBar, allowing you to
inspect each object.  The maximum number of objects that is built is
limited by the max_objects flag.

The option `compare parsers' allows you to parse a single test
sentence for each of the active parsers.

Use the option `parser selection' to activate or de-active a
particular parser.

* The Generate Menu

generate lf. This option is the inverse of the parse option. Now you
are prompted for a logical form, which is subsequently input to the
current generator. Again, you can either specify a logical form `by
hand' or select a pre-existing logical form. Note that there is (yet)
no concept of a test-suite for logical forms.

generate object. This option takes the logical form from the object
that you select, and generates from this logical form. Note that other
information ofthis object is not taken into account in the generation
process.

generator selection. Use this option to activate or de-activate a
particular generator.

compare generators on lf. Generate from a given logical form for each
of the active generators.

compare generators on object. Generate from the logical form of a
given object for each of the active generators.


* The Test-suite Menu

The test-suite menu contains a number of options in order to test the
application for a (pre-defined) set of sentences. This set of
sentences is defined in a file called {suite.pl} in the application
directory, and consists of a number of Prolog clauses for the
predicate sentence/2, where the first argument is a unique identifier
of that sentence, and the second argument is a list of atoms.  Note
that there is (yet) no concept of a test-suite for logical forms.

The following options are provided.

run test-suite. If this option is chosen then all sentences are parsed
in turn, for each of the parsers that are `active'}. Use the `parser
selection' option to select the parsers you want to include/exclude
for the run.

run test-suite and view. This option behaves similar to the previous
option, but in addition statistical information comparing the
different parsers is shown in a separate TK widget. The statistical
information is updated after a sentence has been parsed by all active
parsers.

reload test-suite. Choosing this option reloads the test-suite.
Note that it does *not* destroy existing test-results.

view test-results. This option contains a number of sub-options that
allow you to view the test-results in various ways.

individual tk. Presents a graph in which the length of the
sentence is plotted against the parse time, for each of the different
parsers and sentences.

totals per #words tk. Similarly, but now averages per sentence length
are used.

totals per #words latex. This produces an Xdvi window containing a
table of the parse results, again averaged over sentence-length. Note
that all :atex files are placed in a temporary directory, given by the
environment variable $TMPDIR. If this variable is not set, the
directory /tmp is used.  The predicate latex:files/5 can be used to
get the actual file names that are used.

totals per #readings latex. This produces a table of the parse
results, averaged over the number of readings.

individual prolog. This simply gives a Prolog listing of the
table_entry/6 predicate.

totals per #words prolog. Prolog output of the average cputimes per
parser per #words. This is given as a list of terms
t(Length,Time,Parser) with the obvious interpretation.

destroy test results. Removes the test-results, i.e. retracts all
clauses of the table_entry/6 predicate.


* The View Menu. The `view menu' contains several sub-menus indicating
the type of things you can view. Typically, you can view `objects'
(the result of parsing and generation) `predicates' (Prolog
predicates) and `types' (if your application uses
library(hdrug_feature). For each of the sub-menus you can choose
between different output widgets: Tk, CLiG, Prolog, DOT and LaTeX.
Finally, for each combination of `thing' and `output widget' you can
choose between a number of different output filters. The choice of
filter determines whether the output is printed as a tree, a feature
structure or the internal Prolog encoding.

Note that not all view options will produce results. Sometimes these
options are only defined for particular inputs. For example, in the
Tree Adjoining Grammar application there are parsers that build
derivation trees, and there are parsers that build derived trees.
Hdrug is not always able to tell in advance whether e.g. the
Tree(dt) filter (for derivation trees) is defined for a particular
object.

* The Help Menu. The help menu contains an interface to the various
on-line help resources.  The About button produces a rather ugly
picture of the author of Hdrug. The Version button produces some
information concerning the version of SICStus, Hdrug and application.
Finally some applications add an extra `About the Grammar' option that
mentions the authors of the application.

result. Pressing the button gives rise to a submenu containing three
options. The first option allows inspection of the object. The
possibilities are essentially those described above under the `view

logical form representation of the object (if the application in fact
defines a generator), either for the current generator, or for all
active generators.

%%% LINKING PREDICATES for HOOKS -- HOOK FORWARDING
%%% this techniques is used to allow the current file to be loaded into
%%% modules that we currently don't know about, rather than (just) user.
%%% so, if the current file is loaded into user module, we expect that
%%% the hooks are defined in user, but if the current file is loaded into
%%% e.g. the alpino module, then the hooks are defined in module alpino.

%%% this also implies that any hdrug builtin definitions for these hooks
%%% should also be placed in the same module as current file.

%%% most hooks are called internally in module hdrug. The predicates here
%%% forward these hooks to the module the application is running in.

%%% this one is special because hdrug_cmdint itself defines many
