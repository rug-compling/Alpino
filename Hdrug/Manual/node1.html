<H1>1. HDRUG: A Development Environment for Logic Grammars</H1>
<P>Hdrug is an environment to develop grammars, parsers and generators
for natural languages.  The system provides a number of visualisation
tools, including visualisation of feature structures, syntax trees,
type hierarchies, lexical hierarchies, feature structure trees,
definite clause definitions, grammar rules, lexical entries, chart
datastructures and graphs of statistical information e.g. concerning
cputime requirements of different parsers.  Visualisation can be
requested for various output formats, including ASCII text format, TK
Canvas widget, LaTeX output, DOT output, and CLiG output.</P>
<P>Extendibility and flexibility have been major concerns in the design
of Hdrug.  The Hdrug system provides a small core system with a large
library of auxiliary relations which can be included upon demand.
Hdrug extends a given NLP system with a command interpreter, a
graphical user interface and a number of visualisation tools.
Applications using Hdrug typically add new features on top of the
functionality provided by Hdrug.  The system is easily extendible
because of the use of the Tcl/Tk scripting language, and the
availability of a large set of libraries.  Flexibility is obtained by
a large number of global flags which can be altered easily to change
aspects of the system.  Furthermore, a number of hook predicates can
be defined to adapt the system to the needs of a particular
application.</P>
<P>The flexibility is illustrated by the fact that Hdrug has been used
both for the development of grammars and parsers for practical systems
but also as a tool to experiment
with new theoretical notions and alternative processing strategies.
Furthermore, Hdrug has been used extensively
both for batch processing of large text corpora, and also for
demonstrating particular applications for audiences of non-experts.</P>
<P>Hdrug is implemented in SICStus Prolog version 3, exploiting the
built-in Tcl/Tk library. The Hdrug sources are available free of
charge under the Gnu Public Licence copyright restrictions.</P>
<H2>1.1 <a name="anc1"></a>Interface</H2>
<P>Hdrug provides three ways of interacting with the underlying NLP
system:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Using an extendible command interpreter.</P>
<LI><P>Using Prolog queries.</P>
<LI><P>Using an extendible graphical user interface (based on Tcl/Tk).</P>
</UL><P>The first two approaches are mutually exclusive: if the command
interpreter is listening, then you cannot give ordinary Prolog
commands and vice versa. In contrast, the graphical user interface
(with mouse-driven menu's and buttons) can always be used. This
feature is very important and sets Hdrug apart from competing systems.
It implies that we can use at the same time the full power of the
Prolog prompt (including tracing) and the graphical user interface.
Using the command interpreter (with a history and alias mechanism) can
be useful for experienced users, as it might be somewhat faster than
using the mouse (but note that many menu options can be selected using
accelerators). Furthermore, it is useful for situations in which the
graphical user interface is not available (e.g. in the absence of an X
workstation).  The availability of a command-line interface in
combination with mouse-driven menu's and buttons illustrates the 
<B>flexible</B> nature of the interface.</P>
<P>An important and interesting property of both the command interpreter
and the graphical user interface is <B>extendibility</B>. It is very
easy to add further commands (and associated actions) to the command
interpreter (using straightforward DCG syntax).  The graphical user
interface can be extended by writing Tcl/Tk scripts, possibly in
combination with some Prolog code. A number of examples will be given
in the remainder of this paper.</P>
<P>Finally note that it is also possible to run Hdrug without the
graphical user interface present (simply give the <B>notk</B> option
at startup). This is sometimes useful if no X workstation is available
(e.g. if you connect to the system over a slow serial line), but also
for batch processing.  At any point you can start or stop the
graphical user interface by issuing a simple command.</P>
<H2>1.2 <a name="anc2"></a>Visualisation</H2>
<P>Hdrug supports the visualisation of a large collection of 
data-structures into a number of different formats.</P>
<P>These formats include (at the moment not all datastructures
are supported for all formats. For example, plots of two dimensional
data is only available for Tk):</P>
<UL><LI><P>ASCII art</P>
<LI><P>Tk Canvas</P>
<LI><P>LaTeX</P>
<LI><P>CLiG</P>
<LI><P>DOT</P>
</UL><P>The data-structures for which visualisation is provided
are:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Trees. Various tree definitions can exist in parallel. For example,
the system supports the printing of syntax trees, derivation trees,
type hierarchy trees, lexical hierarchies etc. Actions can be
defined which are executed upon clicking on a node of a tree. New
tree definitions can be added to the system by simple declarations.</P>
<LI><P>Feature structures. Clicking on attributes of a feature-structure
implode or explode the value of that attribute.  Such feature
structures can be the feature structures associated with grammar
rules, lexical entries, macro definitions and parse results.</P>
<LI><P>Trees with feature structure nodes. Again, new tree definitions
can be declared. An example is
<TT><A HREF="dt.png">dt.png</A></TT></P>
<LI><P>Graph (plots of two variable data), e.g. to display the
(average) cputime or memory requirements of different parsers.</P>
<LI><P>Tables.</P>
<LI><P>Prolog clauses.</P>
<LI><P>Definite clauses with feature structure arguments. This can be
used e.g. to visualise macro definitions, lexical entries, and
grammar rules (possibly with associated constraints).</P>
</UL><H2>1.3 <a name="anc3"></a>Parser and Generator Management</H2>
<P>Hdrug provides an interface for the definition of parsers and
generators.  Hdrug manages the results of a parse or generation
request. You can inspect these results later.  Multiple parsers and
generators can co-exist. You can compare some of these parsers with
respect to speed and memory usage on a single example sentence, or on
sets of pre-defined example sentences. Furthermore, actions can be
defined which are executed right before parsing (generation) starts,
or right after the construction of each parse result (generation
result), or right after parsing is completed.</P>
<H2>1.4 <a name="anc4"></a>Useful Libraries</H2>
<P>Most of the visualisation tools are available through libraries as
well. In addition, the Hdrug library contains mechanisms to translate
Prolog terms into feature structures and vice versa (on the basis of a
number of declarations). Furthermore, a library is provided for the
creation of `Mellish' Prolog terms on the basis of boolean expressions
over finite domains. The reverse translation is provided too. Such
terms can be used as values of feature structures to implement a
limited form of disjunction and negation by unification.</P>
<P>A number of smaller utilities is provided in the library as well, such
as the management of global variables, and an extendible on-line help
system.</P>
