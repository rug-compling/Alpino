<H1>6. Interfacing Hdrug</H1>
<P>For an application to work with the Hdrug system, there are a number
of predicates you have to supply. Furthermore, you can extend the Hdrug
system with application-specific options. Finally, you can always
overwrite existing Hdrug definitions. In this chapter I discuss
the various possibilities.</P>
<P>Parsers and Generators</P>
<P>In Hdrug you can define any number of parsers and generators. A parser
and generator is identified by an atomic identifier. A parser is
declared by the following directive:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- flag(parser(Identifier),on/off).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similarly, a generator is declared by:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- flag(generator(Identifier),on/off).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This defines a parser of generator and moreover tells Hdrug whether
this parser is active (on) or not (off).  Only if a parser is active,
it will be used in parser-comparison runs.  Not only should the application
define which parsers and generators exist, but usually it will also
define the `current' parser and generator.  This is achieved by
initializing the <B>parser</B> and <B>generator</B> flag.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- initialize_flag(parser,Identifier).<BR>
:- initialize_flag(generator,Identifier).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Summarizing, there exist a number of parsers. A subset of those
parsers are active. One of the parsers is the current parser.</P>
<P>If a parser (generator) is defined, then there should be a module with
the same name which provides the following predicates. Note that only
the first one of these predicates, parse/1 or generate/1, is
obligatory. The others are not.</P>
<UL><LI><P>parse/1;generate/1. This predicate is the predicate that does the
actual parsing (generation).  At the time of calling, the argument of
the parse/1 (generate/1) predicate is a term o(Obj,Str,Sem) where Obj
is a term in which the top-category is already instantiated.
Furthermore, part of the term might be instantiated to some
representation of the input string (in case of parsing if the
predicate phonology/2 is defined) or some representation of the input
logical form (in case of generation if the predicate semantics/2 is
defined). But note that the string and logical form are also available
(if instantiated) in the second and third argument of the o/3 term.</P>
<LI><P>count/0.This optional predicate is thought of as a predicate that
might produce some statistical information e.g. on the number of chart
edges built. Note that library(hdrug_util) contains predicates to
count the number of clauses for a given predicate.</P>
<LI><P>count/1. Similarly, but this time the argument should get bound to
some integer. The argument of this predicate determines the final
argument of the table_entry/6 predicate in test runs.</P>
<LI><P>clean/0. If the parser adds items, chart edges etc. to the database,
then this predicate defines the way to remove these again.</P>
</UL><P>Top categories</P>
<P>Usually a grammar comes with a notion of a `start symbol' or `top
category'.  In Hdrug there can be any number of different top
categories. These top categories are Prolog terms. Each one of them is
associated with an atomic identifier for reference purposes. Each top
category is defined by a clause for the predicate top/2,
where the first argument is the atomic identifier and the second
argument is the top-category term. For example:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>top(s,node(s,_)).<BR>
top(np,node(np,_)).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The flag `top_features' is used to indicate what the current choice
of top-category is. Usually an application defines a default value for
this flag by the directive:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- initialize_flag(top_features,Identifier).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The identifier relates to the first argument of a top/2 definition.</P>
<P>Strings and Semantics</P>
<P>The predicate semantics/2 defines which part of an object
contains the semantics (if any). For example, in an application
categories are generally of the form node(Syn,Sem). Therefore,
the following definition of semantics/2 is used:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>semantics(node(_,Sem),Sem).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The predicate is mainly used for generation. By default, the predicate
is defined as semantics(_,_).</P>
<P>In a similar way, the predicate phonology(Node,Phon) can be
defined. This is only useful for `sign-based' grammars in which the
string to be parsed is considered a part of the category. The default
definition is phonology(_,_).</P>
<P>The predicate extern_sem/2 can be used to define a mapping between
`internal' and `external' formats of the semantic representation. This
predicate is used in two ways: if a semantic representation is read
in, and if a semantic representation is written out. The first
argument is the external representation, the second argument the
internal one. The default definition is extern_sem(X,X).</P>
<P>Grammar compilation</P>
<P>Currently, the grammar menu contains four distinct options to
recompile (parts of) the grammar. It is assumed that if an application
is started, the grammars are already compiled. These options will thus
be chosen if the grammar has to be recompiled (e.g. because part of
the grammar has been changed).</P>
<P>The following four predicates have to be provided by the application.
If these predicates do not fulfill your needs, you can always extend
the grammar menu (cf. below), or even overwrite it (as in the Ale 
application).</P>
<UL><LI><P>compile_grammar/0 should recompile the whole grammar.</P>
<LI><P>reconsult_grammar/0 should recompile the whole grammar. If files
are to be loaded, then `reconsult' is used rather than `compile'. This
allows easier debugging.</P>
<LI><P>compile_grammar_file/1 should recompile the grammar file that is 
its argument.</P>
<LI><P>reconsult_grammar_file/1 idem, but uses reconsult</P>
</UL><P>Test-suites</P>
<P>A test suite consists of a number of Prolog clauses for the predicate
sentence/2, where the first argument is a unique identifier of that
sentence, and the second argument is a list of atoms; and clauses for
the predicate lf/2.  For example:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>sentence(a,[john,kisses,mary]).<BR>
sentence(b,[john,will,kiss,mary]).<BR>
lf(1,fut(kiss(john,mary))).<BR>
lf(2,past(kiss(mary,john))).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The test suite might also contain a definition of the predicate
user_max/2.  This predicate is used to define an upper time limit,
possibly based on the length of the test sentence (the first
argument), for parsing that sentence in a test-suite run.  By default,
Hdrug behaves as if this predicate is defined as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>user_max(L,Max) :-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max is 10000 + (L <B> L </B> 300).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Statistical information for each parse is preserved by the dynamic
predicate table_entry/6.
The arguments of this predicate
indicate:</P>
<UL><LI><P>an atom (the unique identifier of the sentence)</P>
<LI><P>an integer (the length of the sentence)</P>
<LI><P>an integer (the number of parses of the sentence, i.e. the
degree of ambiguity)</P>
<LI><P>an atom (the name of the parser)</P>
<LI><P>an integer (the amount of milliseconds it took to parse the
sentence. In case of time-out the atom `time_out').</P>
<LI><P>a term (often used to indicate the number of chart-edges built).
It is determined by the count/1.</P>
</UL><P>Extending the Graphical User Interface</P>
<P>It is easy to extend the Graphical User Interface for a specific
application. There are two predicates that you can define. The first
predicate, gram_startup_hook_begin/0 is called before loading of
hdrug.tcl, whereas the predicate gram_startup_hook_end/0 is called at
the end of the loading of this file.</P>
<P>Viewing Prolog Clauses</P>
<P>If you want to use Hdrug's built-in facilities to view Prolog clauses,
then it is neccessary that these clauses are accessible via the
predicate user_clause/2.  The arguments of this predicate are the head
and the body of the clause respectively. The reason that Hdrug does
not use the built-in clause/3 predicate, is that this predicate is
only available for dynamic clauses.</P>
<P>The easiest way to obtain user_clause/2 definitions is to turn on a
term_expansion definition with the appropriate effect. This is done by
setting the user_clause_expansion flag to on.</P>
<H2>6.1. <a name="anc1"></a>use_canvas(+Mode,LeftRightTop)</H2>
<P>Mode is a term indicating the type of data-structure to be displayed. It
is one of tree(TreeMode), fs, text, chart, stat. The predicate should 
instantiate the second argument as one of the atoms left, right or top 
(for a new widget).</P>
<H2>6.2. <a name="anc2"></a>help_hook(PredSymbol,UsageString,ExplanationString)</H2>
<P>This predicate can be defined to provide help on a hook predicate with
predicate symbol PredSymbol. The UsageString is a list of character
codes which shortly shows the usage of the predicate. The help_hook
predicate which is defined for the help_hook predicate itself has as
its UsageString &quot;help_hook(PredSymbol, UsageString,
ExplanationString)&quot;. The ExplanationString is a list of
charactercodes containing further explanation.</P>
<H2>6.3. <a name="anc3"></a>ParserModule:parse(o(Cat,Str,Sem))</H2>
<P>If ParserModule is the current parser, then this predicate is called
to do the actual parsing. At the time of calling, the argument of the
parse/1 predicate is a term o(Obj,Str,Sem) where Cat is a term in
which the top-category  is already instantiated. Furthermore, part of
the term may have been instantiated to some representation of the
input string (if the hook predicate phonology/2 was defined to do
so). The input string is also available in the second argument of the
o/3 term. The third argument is not used for parsing.</P>
<H2>6.4. <a name="anc4"></a>GeneratorModule:generate(o(Cat,Str,Sem))</H2>
<P>If GeneratorModule is the current generator, then this predicate is
called to do the actual generation. At the time of calling, the
argument of the generate/1 predicate is a term o(Obj,Str,Sem) where
Cat is a term in which the top-category  is already
instantiated. Furthermore, part of the term may have been instantiated
to some representation of the input semantics (if the hook predicate
{semantics/2} was defined to do so). The input semantics is also
available in the third argument of the o/3 term. The second argument
is not used for generation.</P>
<H2>6.5. <a name="anc5"></a>Module:count</H2>
<P>This optional predicate is thought of as a predicate that might
display some statistical information e.g. on the number of chart edges
built. The predicate Module:count is called in module Parser after
parsing has been completed for parser Parser or it is called in module
Generator after generation has been completed for generator
Generator. Note that library(hdrug_util) contains predicates to count
the number of clauses for a given predicate.</P>
<H2>6.6. <a name="anc6"></a>Module:count</H2>
<P>This optional predicate is thought of as a predicate that might
display some statistical information e.g. on the number of chart edges
built. The predicate Module:count is called in module Parser after
parsing has been completed for parser Parser or it is called in module
Generator after generation has been completed for generator
Generator. Note that library(hdrug_util) contains predicates to count
the number of clauses for a given predicate.</P>
<H2>6.7. <a name="anc7"></a>Module:clean</H2>
<P>This optional predicate is thought of
as a predicate that might remove e.g. chart edges added dynamically to
the database once parsing has been completed. The predicate
Module:clean is called in module Parser after parsing has been
completed for parser Parser or it is called in module Generator after
generation has been completed for generator Generator.</P>
<H2>6.8. <a name="anc8"></a>start_hook(parse/generate,Module,o(A,B,C),Term)</H2>
<P>This predicate is a hook that is called before the parser starts. Its
first argument is either the atom parse or the atom generate; the
second argument is the current parser or generator (hence the name of
the module); the third argument is an object. The fourth argument can
be anything. It wis provided to pass on arbitrary information to the
result_hook and end_hook hook predicates. For example, the predicate
could pass on information concerning the current memory usage of
Sicstus. This information could then be used by end_hook to compute
the amount of memory that the parser has consumed. The time required
by the start_hook predicate is NOT considered to be part of parsing
time; cf start_hook0/4 for a similar hook predicate of which timing IS
considered part of parsing time</P>
<H2>6.9. <a name="anc9"></a>start_hook0(parse/generate,Module,o(A,B,C),Term)</H2>
<P>This predicate is a hook that is called before the parser starts. Its
first argument is either the atom parse or the atom generate; the
second argument is the current parser or generator (hence the name of
the module); the third argument is an object. The fourth argument can
be anything. It is provided to pass on arbitrary information to the
result_hook and end_hook hook predicates. For example, the predicate
could pass on information concerning the current memory usage of
Sicstus. This information could then be used by end_hook to compute
the amount of memory that the parser has consumed. The time required
by the start_hook0 predicate IS considered to be part of parsing time;
cf start_hook/4 for a similar hook predicate of which timing is NOT
considered part of parsing time</P>
<H2>6.10. <a name="anc10"></a>result_hook(parse/generate,Module,o(A,B,C),Term)</H2>
<P>This predicate is a hook that is called for each time the parser or
generator succeeds. Its first argument is either the atom parse or the
atom generate; the second argument is the current parser or generator
(hence the name of the module); the third argument is an object. The
fourth argument can be anything. It is provided to pass on arbitrary
information from the start_hook hook predicate. Warning: the time
taken by result_hook will always be considered as part of the time
required for parsing. Consider using the demo flag to ensure that
expensive result_hooks are not fired for parsing comparison runs.</P>
<H2>6.11. <a name="anc11"></a>end_hook(parse/generate,Module,o(A,B,C),Term)</H2>
<P>This predicate is a hook that is called if the parser / generator can
not wfind any results anymore. Its first argument is either the atom
parse or the atom generate; the second argument is the current parser
or generator (hence the name of the module); the third argument is an
object. The fourth argument can be anything. It is provided to pass on
arbitrary information from the start_hook hook predicate. Note that at
the moment of calling this predicate the object will typically NOT be
instantiated. The time required by end_hook is NOT considered to be
part of parsing time; see end_hook0.</P>
<H2>6.12. <a name="anc12"></a>end_hook0(parse/generate,Module,o(A,B,C),Term)</H2>
<P>This predicate is a hook that is called if the parser / generator can
not find any results anymore. Its first argument is either the atom
parse or the atom generate; the second argument is the current parser
or generator (hence the name of the module); the third argument is an
object. The fourth argument can be anything. It is provided to pass on
arbitrary information from the start_hook hook predicate. Note that at
the moment of calling this predicate the object will typically NOT be
instantiated. The time required by end_hook0 IS considered to be part
of parsing time; see end_hook0.</P>
<H2>6.13. <a name="anc13"></a>top(Name,Cat)</H2>
<P>Usually a grammar comes with a notion of a `start symbol' or `top
category'. In Hdrug there can be any number of different top
categories, of which one is the currently used top category. These top
categories are Prolog terms. Each one of them is associated with an
atomic identifier for reference purposes. Each top category is defined
by a clause for the predicate top/2, where the first argument is the
atomic identifier and the second argument is the top-category
term. The latter term will be unified with the first argument of the
o/3 terms passed on to parsers and generators.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>top(s,node(s,_)).<BR>
top(np,node(np,_)).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The flag `top_features' is used to indicate what the current choice of
top-category is. Usually an application defines a default value for
this flag. The identifier relates to the first argument of a top/2
definition.</P>
<H2>6.14. <a name="anc14"></a>semantics(Cat,Sem)</H2>
<P>The predicate semantics/2 defines which part of an object contains
the semantics (if any). For example, if in an application categories
are generally of the form node(Syn,Sem), then the following definition
of semantics/2 is used:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>semantics(node(_,Sem),Sem).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The predicate is mainly used for generation.</P>
<H2>6.15. <a name="anc15"></a>phonology(Cat,Phon)</H2>
<P>This predicate is useful for `sign-based' grammars in which the
string to be parsed is considered a part of the category. This
predicate is called before parsing so that in such cases the current
string Phon can be unified with some part of the object.</P>
<H2>6.16. <a name="anc16"></a>extern_sem(Extern,Intern)</H2>
<P>This predicate can be defined in order to distinguish internal and
external semantic representations. This predicate is used in two ways:
if a semantic representation is read in, and if a semantic
representation is written out. The first argument is the external
representation, the second argument the internal one. The default
definition is extern_sem(X,X). A typical usage of this predicate could
be a situation in which an external format such as kisses(john,mary)
is to be translated into a feature structure format such as [
pred=kisses, arg1=john, arg2=mary]. NB, the external format is read in
as a single Prolog term.</P>
<H2>6.17. <a name="anc17"></a>extern_phon(Extern,Intern)</H2>
<P>This predicate can be defined in order to distinguish internal and
external phonological representations. This predicate is used in two
ways: if a phonological representation is read in, and if a
phonological representation is written out. The first argument is the
external representation, the second argument the internal one. The
default definition is extern_phon(X,X). NB, the external format is
read in as a list of Prolog terms.</P>
<H2>6.18. <a name="anc18"></a>sentence(Key,Sentence),
sentence(Key,Max,Sentence)</H2>
<P>Applications can define a number of test sentences by defining
clauses for this predicate. For ease of reference, Key is some atomic
identifier (typically an integer). Sentence is typically a list of
atoms. The parser comparison predicates refer to this atomic
identifier. Example sentences are also listed in the listbox available
through the parse menu-button. Max can be an integer indicating the
maximum amount of milliseconds allowed for this sentence in parser
comparison runs.</P>
<H2>6.19. <a name="anc19"></a>lf(Key,LF), lf(Key,Max,Lf)</H2>
<P>Applications can define a number of test logical forms by defining
clauses for this predicate. For ease of reference, Key is some atomic
identifier (typically an integer). LF is a term (external format of a
logical form). The generator comparison predicates refer to this
atomic identifier. Example logical forms are also listed in the
listbox available through the generate menu-button. Max can be an
integer indicating the maximum amount of milliseconds allowed for this
lf in generator comparison runs.</P>
<H2>6.20. <a name="anc20"></a>user_max(Length,Max)</H2>
<P>This predicate is used to define an upper time limit, possibly based
on the length of the test sentence (the first argument), for parsing
that sentence in a test-suite run. By default, Hdrug behaves as if
this predicate is defined as follows: user_max(L,Max) :- Max is 10000
+ (L <B> L </B> 300). If you don't want a time out at all, then define this
predicate as user_max(_,0).</P>
<H2>6.21. <a name="anc21"></a>gram_startup_hook_begin</H2>
<P>This predicate is meant to be used to extend the graphical user
interface. It is called right before Hdrug's own graphical user
interface definitions are loaded (i.e., right before hdrug.tcl is
sourced).</P>
<H2>6.22. <a name="anc22"></a>gram_startup_hook_end</H2>
<P>This predicate is meant to be used to extend the graphical user
interface. It is called right after Hdrug's own graphical user
interface definitions are loaded (i.e., right after hdrug.tcl is
sourced). A typical use is to add application specific menu-buttons,
etc.</P>
<H2>6.23. <a name="anc23"></a>user_clause(Head,Body)</H2>
<P>If you want to use Hdrug's built-in facilities to view Prolog
clauses, then it is neccessary that these clauses are accessible via
the predicate user_clause/2. The arguments of this predicate are the
head and the body of the clause respectively. Note that the body of
the clause should be provided as a list of goals, rather than a
conjunction. The reason that Hdrug does not use the built-in clause/3
predicate, is that this predicate is only available for dynamic
clauses. The easiest way to obtain user_clause/2 definitions is to
turn on a term_expansion definition with the appropriate effect; cf
flag(user_clause_expansion).</P>
<H2>6.24. <a name="anc24"></a>graphic_path(Format,Obj,Term)</H2>
<P>One of the three hook predicates which together define tree
formats. The others are graphic_label/3 and graphic_daughter/4. The
Hdrug libraries contain extensive possibilities to produce output in
the form of trees. Only a few declarations are needed to define what
things you want to see in the tree. In effect, such declarations
define a `tree format'. In Hdrug, there can be any number of tree
formats. These tree formats are named by a ground identifier. A tree
format consists of three parts: the path definition indicates what
part of the object you want to view as a tree; the label definition
indicates how you want to print the node of a tree; and the daughter
definition indicates what you consider the daughters of a node. The
graphic_path definition is the first part. For instance if the parser
creates an object of the form node(Syn,Sem,DerivTree) where DerivTree
is a derivation tree, then we can define a tree format `dt' where the
graphic_path definition extracts the third argument of this term:
graphic_path(dt,node(_,_,Tree),Tree).</P>
<H2>6.25. <a name="anc25"></a>graphic_label(Format,Node,Label)</H2>
<P>One of the three hook predicates which together define tree
formats. The others are graphic_path/3 and graphic_daughter/4. The
Hdrug libraries contain extensive possibilities to produce output in
the form of trees. Only a few declarations are needed to define what
things you want to see in the tree. In effect, such declarations
define a `tree format'. In Hdrug, there can be any number of tree
formats. These tree formats are named by a ground identifier. A tree
format consists of three parts: the path definition indicates what
part of the object you want to view as a tree; the label definition
indicates how you want to print the node of a tree; and the daughter
definition indicates what you consider the daughters of a node. The
graphic_label definition is the second part. For instance, if subtrees
are of the form tree(Node,Ds), where Node are terms representing
syntactic objects such as np(Agr,Case) and vp(Agr,Subcat,Sem) then a
tree format could be defined which only displays the functor symbol:
graphic_label(syn,tree(Term,_),Label) :- functor(Term,Label,_).</P>
<H2>6.26. <a name="anc26"></a>graphic_daughter(Format,No,Term,Daughter)</H2>
<P>One of the three hook predicates which together define tree
formats. The others are graphic_label/3 and graphic_daughter/4. The
Hdrug libraries contain extensive possibilities to produce output in
the form of trees. Only a few declarations are needed to define what
things you want to see in the tree. In effect, such declarations
define a `tree format'. In Hdrug, there can be any number of tree
formats. These tree formats are named by a ground identifier. A tree
format consists of three parts: the path definition indicates what
part of the object you want to view as a tree; the label definition
indicates how you want to print the node of a tree; and the daughter
definition indicates what you consider the daughters of a node. The
graphic_daughter definition is the third part. For instance if
subtrees are of the form tree(Label,Daughters), where Daughters is a
list of daughters, then you could simply define:
graphic_daughter(syn,No,tree(_,Ds),D):- lists:nth(No,Ds,D).</P>
<H2>6.27. <a name="anc27"></a>show_node(Format,Node)</H2>
<P>If trees are displayed on the canvas widget, then it is possible to
define an action for clicking the left-most mouse button on the node
of the tree. This action is defined by this predicate. Format is the
identifier of a tree format, and Node is the full sub-tree (that was
used as input to the graphic_label definition).</P>
<H2>6.28. <a name="anc28"></a>show_node2(Format,Node)</H2>
<P>If trees are displayed on the canvas widget, then it is possible to
define an action for clicking the middle mouse button on the node of
the tree. This action is defined by this predicate. Format is the
identifier of a tree format, and Node is the full sub-tree (that was
used as input to the graphic_label definition).</P>
<H2>6.29. <a name="anc29"></a>show_node3(Format,Node)</H2>
<P>If trees are displayed on the canvas widget, then it is possible to
define an action for clicking the rightmost mouse button on the node
of the tree. This action is defined by this predicate. Format is the
identifier of a tree format, and Node is the full sub-tree (that was
used as input to the graphic_label definition).</P>
<H2>6.30. <a name="anc30"></a>tk_tree_user_node(Label,Frame)</H2>
<P>If a tree-format is defined which matches user(_), then if a tree is
to be displayed on the Canvas widget this predicate is responsible for
creating the actual nodes of the tree. Label is the current label, and
Frame is the identifier of a Tcl/Tk frame which should be further used
for this label. The frame is already packed.</P>
<H2>6.31. <a name="anc31"></a>clig_tree_user_node(Label)</H2>
<P>If a tree-format is defined which matches user(_), then if a tree is
to be displayed using Clig output, then this predicate is responsible
for creating the actual nodes of the tree. Label is the current
label.</P>
<H2>6.32. <a name="anc32"></a>dot_tree_user_node(Label)</H2>
<P>If a tree-format is defined which matches user(_), then if a tree is
to be displayed using DOT output, then this predicate is responsible
for creating the actual label of the nodes of the tree. Label is the current
label.</P>
<H2>6.33. <a name="anc33"></a>latex_tree_user_node(Label)</H2>
<P>If a tree-format is defined which matches user(_), then if a tree is
to be displayed using LaTeX output, then this predicate is responsible
for creating the actual nodes of the tree. Label is the current
label.</P>
<H2>6.34. <a name="anc34"></a>shorten_label(Label0,Label)</H2>
<P>This predicate can be defined for feature-structure display of tree
nodes; its intended use is to reduce the information of a given
node.</P>
<H2>6.35. <a name="anc35"></a>call_build_lab(F,Fs,L)</H2>
<P>for library(hdrug_call_tree)</P>
<H2>6.36. <a name="anc36"></a>call_build_lab(Functor/Arity)</H2>
<P>for library(hdrug_call_tree)</P>
<H2>6.37. <a name="anc37"></a>exceptional_sentence_length(Phon,Length)</H2>
<P>For (internal) phonological representations this predicate can be
defined to return the length of the representation. If the predicate
is not defined, then the representation is assumed to be a list, and
the length is assumed to be the number of elements of the list. The
length of phonological representations is used by the display of the
results of parser comparison runs.</P>
<H2>6.38. <a name="anc38"></a>exceptional_lf_length(Sem,Length)</H2>
<P>For (internal) semantic representations this predicate can be defined
to return the length of the representation. If the predicate is not
defined, then the representation is assumed to be a term, and the
length is assumed to be the number of characters required to print the
term. The length of semantic representations is used by the display of
the results of generator comparison runs.</P>
<H2>6.39. <a name="anc39"></a>hdrug_initialization</H2>
<P>If hdrug is started, then three things happen. First, hdrug treats
its command line options. After that, the predicate
hdrug_initialization is called. Finally, the graphical user interface
is started (if flag(tcltk) is on). This predicate can thus be used to
define application-specific initialization.</P>
<H2>6.40. <a name="anc40"></a>hdrug_command(Name,Goal,Args)</H2>
<P>This predicate can be used to define further commands for the command
interpreter. Name is the first word of the command, Goal is the
resulting Prolog goal, and Args is a possibly empty list of arguments
to the command.</P>
<H2>6.41. <a name="anc41"></a>hdrug_command_help(Name,UsageString,ExplanationString)</H2>
<P>This predicate can be used to provide help information on commands
for the command interpreter. Name is the first word of the command,
The second argument displays usage information in a short form (list
of character codes); the third argument is a list of character codes
containing an explanation of the command.</P>
<H2>6.42. <a name="anc42"></a>help_flag(Flag,Help)</H2>
<P>This predicate can be used to provide help information on global
variable Flag. Help is a list of character codes containing the help
info.</P>
<H2>6.43. <a name="anc43"></a>option(Option,ArgvIn,ArgvOut)</H2>
<P>This predicate can be used to define application-specific
command-line options to the hdrug command. Option is the option minus
the minus sign; moreover Option relates to the first argument of a
corresponding usage_option/3 definition. The second and third argument
is a difference list of the list of options in case the option takes
further arguments.</P>
<H2>6.44. <a name="anc44"></a>usage_option(Option,UsageString,ExplanationString)</H2>
<P>This predicate is defined to provide help information on the Option
startup option (cf. option/3). The UsageString is a list of character
codes presenting short usage information; ExplanationString is a list
of character codes containing the explanation of the option.</P>
<H2>6.45. <a name="anc45"></a>tk_tree_show_node_help(TreeFormat,Atom)</H2>
<P>If a tree according to TreeFormat is displayed on the canvas, then
this predicate can be defined in order that below the widget a short
message appears indicating what actions are bound to clicking on the
tree nodes. Atom is the message.</P>
<H2>6.46. <a name="anc46"></a>show_relation(F/A)</H2>
<P>you can define the relation show_relation/1 to define an action for
pressing the first mouse-button on a relation name, when viewing
predicate definitions in the Tk Canvas. The argument is a
Functor/Arity pair. For example,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>show_relation(F/A) :-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show_predicate(F/A,fs,tk).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>will show the predicate definition.</P>
<H2>6.47. <a name="anc47"></a>display_extern_sem(+ExtSem)</H2>
<P>Predicate to print a given external format of semantics.</P>
<H2>6.48. <a name="anc48"></a>display_extern_phon(+ExtPhon)</H2>
<P>Predicate to print a given external format of phonology.</P>
<H2>6.49. <a name="anc49"></a>compile_test_suite(+File)</H2>
<P>Predicate to compile the test suite in file File.</P>
<H2>6.50. <a name="anc50"></a>reconsult_test_suite(+File)</H2>
<P>Predicate to reconsult the test suite in file File.</P>
<H2>6.51. <a name="anc51"></a>show_object_default2(+Int)</H2>
<P>Predicate which is called if the user presses mouse button &lt;2&gt; on the
object button number Int. A typical definition could be, for instance:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>show_object_default2(No):-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show_object_no(No,tree(syn),clig).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>6.52. <a name="anc52"></a>show_object_default3(+Int)</H2>
<P>Predicate which is called if the user presses mouse button &lt;2&gt; on the
object button number Int.</P>
