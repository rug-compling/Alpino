<H1>5. Graphical User Interface</H1>
<P>The Hdrug widget
(<TT><A HREF="ale1.png">ale1.png</A></TT>)
contains the following sub-widgets (from top-to-bottom).</P>
<UL><LI><P>MenuBar. The MenuBar contains a number of menubuttons. Each of
these menu's is described below.</P>
<LI><P>ObjectBar. The ObjectBar is initially invisible. Once `objects' are
produced by a parser or generator these objects will be placed on this
bar.</P>
<LI><P>Two scrollable canvases. Each canvas is initially left blank but is
used for graphical output such as parse-trees, etc. You can scroll the
canvas using the scrollbars, but also using the middle mouse
button. The relative size of the canvases can be adapted by dragging
the border with the left mouse button, or with the file-enlarge left
canvas resp. enlarge right canvas commands.</P>
<LI><P>TkConsol. If the global variable tkconsol is on, then the
TkConsol widget treats standard input, standard output and error
output.</P>
<LI><P>ButtonBar. The ButtonBar contains three buttons that can be used to
change the value of the top category, the parser and the
generator. The current values of these are also listed next to the
corresponding buttons. The checkbox `new canvas' can be switched on in
order for the next graphical output to be directed to a seperate
window. Finally the rightmost button is a button that is added by manu
applications, and which functions as an `About' button.</P>
</UL><H2>5.1. <a name="anc1"></a>The MenuBar</H2>
<UL><LI><P>The File Menu. The file menu contains buttons of which the meaning is
rather straightforward. The first items can be used to (re)compile
grammar files. The detailed meaning is dependent on the application.</P>
</UL><P>The `compile prolog file' button lets you choose a Prolog file
which will be compiled. The `reconsult prolog file' button
behaves similarly but reconsults the file. The `source tk/tcl file'
button can be used to source a Tcl/Tk file. The `halt' button
halts the application (really!).</P>
<P>The `enlarge left canvas' and `enlarge right canvas' buttons
adapt the relative size of the two canvases.</P>
<P>It is also possible to restart the application. This implies that the
graphical environment is restarted, but the application files are not
reconsulted. This is useful if you are adding/debugging parts of the
graphical interface. Use `restart x' to restart.  `quit x -
keep prolog alive' allows you to stop the interface, but continue
the Prolog session.</P>
<UL><LI><P>The Debug Menu. The debug menu contains a few buttons that are
straightforward interfaces to the corresponding Prolog predicates. It
contains the options</P>
<LI><P>nodebug</P>
<LI><P>debug</P>
<LI><P>remove spypoints</P>
<LI><P>spy predicate</P>
<LI><P>unspy predicate</P>
<LI><P>statistics</P>
<LI><P>The Options Menu. The options menu provides an interface to the
global variables.</P>
<LI><P>The Parse Menu. The parse menu is a more interesting menu, although it
consists of only a single button.  Pressing this button will present a
dialog widget asking you for a sentence. You can either type in a new
sentence, or select one of the available test sentences. The available
sentences are the sentences that were previously parsed during the
current session, or that were listed in the test-suite, or that were
the result of generation in the current session. The sentence you type
or select will be parsed using the current parser, and the current top
category. Some statistical output will be presented on standard
output. For each parse result a numbered object is created. Each
object is visible as a button on the ObjectBar, allowing you to
inspect each object.  The maximum number of objects that is built is
limited by the max_objects flag.</P>
</UL><P>The option `compare parsers' allows you to parse a single test
sentence for each of the active parsers.</P>
<P>Use the option `parser selection' to activate or de-active a
particular parser.</P>
<UL><LI><P>The Generate Menu</P>
</UL><P>generate lf. This option is the inverse of the parse option. Now you
are prompted for a logical form, which is subsequently input to the
current generator. Again, you can either specify a logical form `by
hand' or select a pre-existing logical form. Note that there is (yet)
no concept of a test-suite for logical forms.</P>
<P>generate object. This option takes the logical form from the object
that you select, and generates from this logical form. Note that other
information ofthis object is not taken into account in the generation
process.</P>
<P>generator selection. Use this option to activate or de-activate a
particular generator.</P>
<P>compare generators on lf. Generate from a given logical form for each
of the active generators.</P>
<P>compare generators on object. Generate from the logical form of a
given object for each of the active generators.</P>
<UL><LI><P>The Test-suite Menu</P>
</UL><P>The test-suite menu contains a number of options in order to test the
application for a (pre-defined) set of sentences. This set of
sentences is defined in a file called {suite.pl} in the application
directory, and consists of a number of Prolog clauses for the
predicate sentence/2, where the first argument is a unique identifier
of that sentence, and the second argument is a list of atoms.  Note
that there is (yet) no concept of a test-suite for logical forms.</P>
<P>The following options are provided.</P>
<P>run test-suite. If this option is chosen then all sentences are parsed
in turn, for each of the parsers that are `active'}. Use the `parser
selection' option to select the parsers you want to include/exclude
for the run.</P>
<P>run test-suite and view. This option behaves similar to the previous
option, but in addition statistical information comparing the
different parsers is shown in a separate TK widget. The statistical
information is updated after a sentence has been parsed by all active
parsers.</P>
<P>reload test-suite. Choosing this option reloads the test-suite.
Note that it does <B>not</B> destroy existing test-results.</P>
<P>view test-results. This option contains a number of sub-options that
allow you to view the test-results in various ways.</P>
<P>individual tk. Presents a graph in which the length of the 
sentence is plotted against the parse time, for each of the different
parsers and sentences.</P>
<P>totals per #words tk. Similarly, but now averages per sentence length
are used.</P>
<P>totals per #words latex. This produces an Xdvi window containing a
table of the parse results, again averaged over sentence-length. Note
that all :atex files are placed in a temporary directory, given by the
environment variable $TMPDIR. If this variable is not set, the
directory /tmp is used.  The predicate latex:files/5 can be used to
get the actual file names that are used.</P>
<P>totals per #readings latex. This produces a table of the parse
results, averaged over the number of readings.</P>
<P>individual prolog. This simply gives a Prolog listing of the 
table_entry/6 predicate.</P>
<P>totals per #words prolog. Prolog output of the average cputimes per
parser per #words. This is given as a list of terms 
t(Length,Time,Parser) with the obvious interpretation.</P>
<P>destroy test results. Removes the test-results, i.e. retracts all
clauses of the table_entry/6 predicate.</P>
<UL><LI><P>The View Menu. The `view menu' contains several sub-menus indicating
the type of things you can view. Typically, you can view `objects'
(the result of parsing and generation) `predicates' (Prolog
predicates) and `types' (if your application uses
library(hdrug_feature). For each of the sub-menus you can choose
between different output widgets: Tk, CLiG, Prolog, DOT and LaTeX.
Finally, for each combination of `thing' and `output widget' you can
choose between a number of different output filters. The choice of
filter determines whether the output is printed as a tree, a feature
structure or the internal Prolog encoding.</P>
</UL><P>Note that not all view options will produce results. Sometimes these
options are only defined for particular inputs. For example, in the
Tree Adjoining Grammar application there are parsers that build
derivation trees, and there are parsers that build derived trees.
Hdrug is not always able to tell in advance whether e.g. the 
Tree(dt) filter (for derivation trees) is defined for a particular
object.</P>
<UL><LI><P>The Help Menu. The help menu contains an interface to the various
on-line help resources.  The About button produces a rather ugly
picture of the author of Hdrug. The Version button produces some
information concerning the version of SICStus, Hdrug and application.
Finally some applications add an extra `About the Grammar' option that
mentions the authors of the application.</P>
</UL><H2>5.2. <a name="anc2"></a>The ObjectBar</H2>
<UL><LI><P>ObjectBar. The results of parsing and generation are asserted in the
database as `objects'. The existence of objects is indicated in the
ObjectBar. For example, if we have parsed the sentence `jan kust
marie' in an application, then the ObjectBar contains two buttons,
labeled `1' and `2', indicating the first and second parse
result. Pressing the button gives rise to a submenu containing three
options. The first option allows inspection of the object. The
possibilities are essentially those described above under the `view
menu'. The second and third option allow the generation from the
logical form representation of the object (if the application in fact
defines a generator), either for the current generator, or for all
active generators.</P>
</UL><H2>5.3. <a name="anc3"></a>The ButtonBar</H2>
<UL><LI><P>ButtonBar. The ButtonBar contains maximally three buttons that can be
used to change the value of the top category, the parser and the
generator. The current values of these are also listed next to the
corresponding buttons. Note that there is only a `generator' button if
there are generators defined; similarly the `parser' button might not
exist in some applications.</P>
