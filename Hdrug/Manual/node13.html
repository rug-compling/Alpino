<H1>13. hdrug_show: Visualization</H1>
<P>The libraries contain predicates to visualize trees,
feature-structures and Prolog terms (including Prolog clauses). A
number of different output media are available: LaTeX, Tcl/Tk, CLiG, DOT,
and ordinary text output. The visualization tools are all available by
means of a single generic predicate show/3.</P>
<P>Viewing Prolog Terms representing Feature Structures</P>
<P>Note that a couple of predicates are available to view Prolog terms as
feature structures. Again, the predicate show/3 is available as an
interface to this functionality. For example, you might
try the conjunction:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Y:cat:agr &lt;=&gt; Y:cat:subj:cat:agr, show(fs,tk,[value(Y)]).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Instead of <B>tk</B>, any of the identifiers <B>latex</B>, <B>user</B>, <B>clig</B>, <B>dot</B> can be
used to direct the output to a different medium. For instance, the
query</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Y:cat:agr &lt;=&gt; Y:cat:subj:cat:agr, show(fs,latex,[value(Y)]).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>But if you insist on ordinary output, try:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>show(fs,user,[value(X)]).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This produces:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>{sign}<BR>
|cat {verb}<BR>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|agr &lt;A&gt;<BR>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|subj {sign}<BR>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|cat {cat}<BR>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|agr &lt;A&gt;.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Not only can you view feature structures this way, but also clauses;
cf. show/3 below.</P>
<P>Tree Formats</P>
<P>The libraries contain extensive possibilities to produce output in the
form of trees. Only a few declarations are needed to define what
things you want to see in the tree. In effect, such declarations
define a `tree format'.</P>
<P>In Hdrug, there can be any number of tree formats. These tree formats
are named by a ground identifier. A tree format consists of three
parts: the <B>path</B> definition indicates what part of the object you
want to view as a tree; the <B>label</B> definition indicates how you want
to print the node of a tree; and the <B>daughter</B> definition indicates
what you consider the daughters of a node.</P>
<P>Because we want to be able to have multiple tree formats around, we
must declare the corresponding predicates `multifile', as otherwise
existing tree formats would be erased.</P>
<P>For example, the following predicates define a tree-format called `s'
(this example is taken from the `Dcg' application).</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- multifile graphic_path/3.<BR>
graphic_path(s,node(_,S),S).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- multifile graphic_label/3.<BR>
graphic_label(s,Term,Label) :-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functor(Term,Label,_).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- multifile graphic_daughter/4.<BR>
graphic_daughter(s,1,Term,D) :-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arg(1,Term,D).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>graphic_daughter(s,2,Term,D) :-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arg(2,Term,D).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The first predicate defines that we want to take the semantics part
of a node as the term that we want to view as a tree. The second
predicate defines that for a given tree Term we want to print its
functor as the node label. Finally the third predicate defines that
for a given tree Term the first daughter is to be the first
argument of the term, and the second daughter is to be the second
argument.</P>
<P>As another example of a tree format definition, consider the
constraint-based Categorial Grammar application.
application. Here we find:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- multifile graphic_path/3.<BR>
graphic_path(syn,Obj,Obj).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- multifile graphic_label/3.<BR>
graphic_label(syn,tree(Sign,_,[_|_]),Label) :-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cat_symbol(Sign,Label).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>graphic_label(syn,tree(W,_,[]),W).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>:- multifile graphic_daughter/4.<BR>
graphic_daughter(syn,No,tree(_,_,[H|T]),D) :-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nth(No,[H|T],D).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Here, objects generally are of the form tree(Node,_,ListOfDs).
Therefore, the path part of the tree format definition simply unifies
the object and the tree part. The label part of the tree format
definition distinguishes two cases. If there are no more daughters,
then the node is a terminal, and this terminal is simply taken to be
the node label. In the other case the node label is defined by a
seperate predicate `cat_symbol'. This predicate changes the internal
representation into some more readable format. Finally, the daughter
part of the tree format definition uses the Sicstus library predicate
`nth'.  The effect of the definition is that the first daughter is the
first element of the daughter list, etc.</P>
<P>Tk Output</P>
<P>The library defines the predicate show/3 index{show (predicate)} as a generic
interface to the visualization tools. If a tree is to be displayed on
the Tcl/Tk Canvas widget, then we can use this predicate by taking the 
desired tree format as the first argument, the atom {   t tk} as the
second argument, and a list of objects we want to be displayed as the
third and final argument.  For instance:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>?- findall(object(A,B), object(A,B), Objects),<BR>
   show(syn,tk,Objects).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If the tree is output thru the Tk/Tcl canvas, then the nodes of the
trees are buttons. For each tree format we can define what action
should be undertaken if a button is pressed. This is defined by the
predicate show_node/2. The first argument is the identifier of the
tree format, the second argument is the current node (note: this is
not the label as defined by graphic_label, but the term on the basis
of which graphic_label is defined).</P>
<P>The following definition, from the Constraint-based Categorial Grammar
application, prints the node as a feature structure in a separate Tk
window.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>show_node(syn,tree(Sign,[_|_],_)) :-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show(fs,tk,[value(Sign)]).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If this predicate is not defined then the label will simply be written
out as a Prolog term to standard output.</P>
<P>Similarly, the predicates show_node2/2 and show_node3/2 can be used
to define an action for pressing the second and third mouse-button
respectively. Generally these predicates should be defined multifile.</P>
<P>LaTeX output</P>
<P>The predicate show/3 is also used to produce LaTeX output of
trees. A variant of the previous example produces LaTeX:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>?- findall(object(A,B), object(A,B), Objects),<BR>
   show(syn,latex,Objects).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This ensures that a LaTeX file is created and the appropriate shell
commands are called to get ghostview to display the tree. The first
argument is the name of a tree-format.</P>
<P>CLiG Output</P>
<P>A further possibility concerns is to use the CLiG system for
displaying output. In that case the example becomes;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>?- findall(object(A,B), object(A,B), Objects),<BR>
   show(syn,latex,Objects).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dot Output</P>
<P>For trees, you can also use the DOT graph visualization programme.</P>
<P>ASCII Art Output</P>
<P>Ordinary text (to standard output) is available as well; in that case
the identifier <B>user</B> is used:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>?- findall(object(A,B), object(A,B), Objects),<BR>
   show(syn,user,Objects).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Trees of feature structures</P>
<P>Trees in which each of the nodes is a feature-structure are supported
for Tk output and LaTeX output. Nodes are interpreted as a
description of a feature-structure if the tree format identifier
matches matrix(_).</P>
<P>User defined action for a given node can be obtained using a tree
format which matches user(_). In such a case you are responsible for
displaying a given node by defining the predicate tk_tree_user_node/2
where the first argument is the label of the current node, and the
second argument is a Tcl/Tk frame identifier already packed as part of
the tree, which can be further worked upon.</P>
<P>Visualization of clauses</P>
<P>The third argument of the predicate show
can be a clause. An is example is
<TT><A HREF="clause.png">clause.png</A></TT></P>
<P>Visualization of the type declarations</P>
<P>Refer to the predicates pretty_type/0, pretty_type/1.</P>
