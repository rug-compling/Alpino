What is Hdrug?
--------------

Hdrug is an environment to develop logic grammars / parsers /
generators for natural languages. The package requires SICStus
Prolog version 3, and the Tcl/Tk libraries.

Hdrug offers various tools to visualize lexical entries, grammar
rules, definite-clause definitions, parse trees, feature structures,
lexical- rule- and type-hierarchies, graphs of the comparison of
different parsers on a corpus of test sentences etc. Visualizations
are provided in a Tk widget, in LaTeX/DVI format, and using the
Clig. Hdrug allows for easy comparison of different
parsers/generators; it has extensive possibilities to compile feature
equations into Prolog terms; it can produce graphical (Tk), and
ordinary Prolog output of trees, feature structures, Prolog terms (and
combinations thereof), plotted graphs of statistical information, and
tables of statistical information.  The package comes with a number of
example grammars, including parsers and generators.
