# Alpino
Alpino parser and related tools for Dutch

As per October 18, 2019, we use git at github.com for the distribution of Alpino. Note that old history is not included (for reasons of size). The old history is still available under subversion at the local server in Groningen.

Note: you need the lfs extension to git to be able to do a clone.
Normally, something like this should suffice:

sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
